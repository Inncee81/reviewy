<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>Size:36-Piece
The Dremel 4200 variable speed rotary tool is the first ever rotary tool with the EZ Change mechanism for the easiest and quickest accessory change. Trademark to Dremel, the innovative EZ Change system is the fully integrated quick-change mechanism that allows easy and fast accessory changes without a wrench. Now, completing projects will be more convenient and faster than ever before. In addition to the EZ Change system, the Dremel 4200 has a high-performance 1.6-Amp motor for maximum power at all speeds. The variable speed of this revolutionary rotary tool ranges from 5,000 to 35,000 RPM. Attributed to this variable speed, the Dremel 4200 has greater versatility than any other rotary tool. In addition to the variable speed is the electronic feedback that allows for consistent speed under load. Offering the highest performance and most versatility of all Dremel rotary tools, the Dremel 4200 features electronic feedback circuitry that enables consistent performance at all speed levels. The Dremel 4200 can use all existing Dremel accessories and attachments to complete the widest range of projects. A slim, ergonomic body provides a 360-degree grip zone for comfort and control in any grip position. The 4200 has a separate on-and-off switch and variable speed dial that allow convenient speed adjustment while maintaining the selected speed even when tool is turned off. The Dremel 4200-<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>36</sub> kit includes 4-attachments and 36-accessories. Two year limited warranty.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="ez-change-nice-concept-poor-implementation">EZ Change: Nice Concept; Poor Implementation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At first glance - the 4200 is a very good deal, taken into consideration all the items that are included with the kit compared to individual cost of each included accessories.Unfortunately - in actual real world use - the EZ Change system proves to be the the weakest point of the design.Product FeaturesMost powerful and versatile rotary tool in the Dremel line ( TRUE - but not by much, only 5,000RPM / 30 to 35K difference)EZ Change system-change all Dremel accessories without the wrench or collet lock (not TRUE, in fact, you need 4 sizes of collets (Dremel 4485) / and the worst part, you need a long nose plair to change them which completely defeats the purpose)Cooler running with 20-percent more air flow in venting design (YES- TRUE, but i dont like it, when i set the unit to max power, its like a blower and the air is vented underneath)Variable speed of 5,000 - 35,000 RPM with electronic feedback (TRUE - but not all attachments can be used at 35,000; in real world use, mostly- you will be using 15-25,000RPM)Includes 6 attachments and 40 accessories for maximum versatility (NOT TRUE - this is very misleading - when they say 40, they are actually counting each individual item, like 4 sanding wheels, 6 cutting wheels, 2 brushes, 4 buffers, etc.) - also, the nomenclature included with my 4200 unit was wrong - it listed all the accessories of DREMEL but the 4200 was not listed (what the hell)~ Also, the DREMEL 4486 Chuck will not work on the EZ change and so far to date - they are not offering any connector/attachment to let you use it.If you plan to buy this - IMHO - you are better off buying the Dremel 4000-<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub> or any 4000 series combos.I end up returning mine and replaced it with the 8220 series. It will cost me more but at least I can use all the Dremel attachments and accessories that I want.Again, the 4200 combo is a great deal for all the attachments included comparable to its price but - if you plan to buy more attachments and different size bits, you will quickly find yourself wanting the 4000 - also the 4000 can be adapted to use the EZ change system but the 4200 is not backward compatible (as of this writing)Hope this helps.</p>

<h5 id="best-dremel-tool-yet">Best Dremel tool yet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the best Dremel tool yet.I simply love the EZ change system. I always hated having to fetch the wrench to changing bits and now I don&rsquo;t.Now that I have this one, I never reach for the other Dremels I have. I do have one mounted to the Dremel Rotary Tool Work Station as you would have to modify the workstation to work with this one but other than that this is by far the best one yet.I like the case as it comes with a slot to store the flex shaft. Since I had other Dremels I put off buying this one for a while but I&rsquo;m glad I broke down and got this one. I LOVE IT!</p>

<h5 id="4200-junk-tool">4200 JUNK Tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The 4200 Rotary Tool itself is junk. The chuck will not hold the bits tight enough and will allow them to slip. Needless to say after struggling with a project and not being able to finish it , the Rotary Tool wound up right where it belongs, IN THE GARBAGE.As for accessories, Not a big fan of the quick change cutting wheels. Too much side to side movement. The quick change sanding wheel doesn&rsquo;t hold the sanding drums tight enough and allows the drums to slip off the end.If you&rsquo;re considering this tool, I would suggest going with the 4000 model instead to alleviate the quick change headache.</p>

<h5 id="i-always-heard-dremel-was-the-best-but-this-model-needs-a-lot-of-work">I always heard Dremel was the best, but this model needs a lot of work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have ordered and received this item twice. The first one worked for maybe 10 minutes and the second maybe 5. I don&rsquo;t know if it a product defect that Dremel needs to fix or what. After the last one I went on-line for a rating and it averaged a 1. I always heard Dremel was the best, but this model needs a lot of work.</p>

<h5 id="another-great-tool-from-dremel">Another great tool from Dremel</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What can you say bad about a Dremel? Nothing, they are great products, and this one is no exception. This is a step up from the basic model, and worked great. Note, the plastic shield is a nice accessory, but it is not a replacement for eye protection. It should really be viewed as something to help protect your shirt, more than your eyes. As I was using the product I began to rotate the tool and the metal shavings began to spray me - I quickly grabbed my safety glasses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most complete set I have gotten from Dremel ,l had the old X400 set with all attachments but had to buy many separate (planner, mini receipting saw. this set comes well fitted out. I use the tool for woodcarving and making staffs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After 3 years of using the Dremel 4200, the tool died. Luck for me I found my 3 year old receipt that I previously had printed from Amazon. I called the number listed in my owner&rsquo;s manual and called the company. They emailed me a return invoice to fill out. You need to include your receipt as proof of purchase. The received my broken Dremel 4200 along with my proof of purchase receipt and sent me a new Dremel 4300 in less than a week. I am a happy camper!</p>

<p>The Dremel was a gift to my wife. Unfortunately and need to figure out how to return it because it has stopped working and the return date was for only 30 days. She didn&rsquo;t get a chance to use it until a couple of months later. Can anyone help me out?</p>
