<h5 id="93-53mb-s-sequential-reads-and-56-63mb-s-sequential-writes">93.53MB/s sequential reads and 56.63MB/s sequential writes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great, very fast, no compatibility issues with devices that support SDXC. Was able to do 93.53MB/s sequential reads and 56.63MB/s sequential writes. The random writes are slower, so this wouldn&rsquo;t be great for an OS (like a Raspberry Pi). But perfectly designed and very fast for a camera recording images or video.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="alert-these-may-not-be-truly-uhs-i-u3">ALERT! These may not be truly UHS-I U3</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I purchase this in order to record 4k on my Sony AX33 using the 100mbs for the highest quality 4k (vs 60mbs). I install the card and I set to 100mbs but, receive a message that I must install a U3 card. That is what I purchased. I did some research online and found a reference where some where having the same issue and others were not. I decided to go to a local store and I found the exact same PNY SD card. I purchased it and tried it at home. Well guess what? It worked! Not errors. I looked at both packages in great detail and only found a few differences. Note the pictures: The SD card on the right DOES work as a UHS-I U3 @ 100mbs the one on the left I purchased from amazon and is NOT recognized as a UHS-I U3. I have attached a video demonstrating the error I receive when trying to use one over the other.PNY Elite Performance 64 GB High Speed SDXC Class 10 UHS-I, U3 up to 95 MB/Sec Flash Card (P-SDX64U395-GE)</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-my-2013-mac-book-pro-music-and-pictures">Perfect for my 2013 Mac Book Pro Music and Pictures</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did my research and it paid off! This just expanded my 2013 Mac Book Pro by 50%! To test, I ran Disk Speed Check from Blackmagicdesign. I get 86MB/s read and 15MB/s write speeds. By comparison, the internal drive gets 350MB/s read and 150MB/s write speeds. So, I&rsquo;m using this to store all of my photos and music which frees up my faster internal drive for more demanding tasks. The more expensive SD cards warn about this catching on things, but I beg to differ. It only sticks out by about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo;, it is firmly seated, and it it on the side of the computer not the front or back which slides into the bag. There is no chance of this catching on anything.</p>

<h5 id="great-card-at-a-great-price-90-mb-s-reads-and-60-mb-s-writes-what-else-could-you-ask-for">Great card at a Great Price!!!! 90+Mb/s reads and 60+Mb/s writes, what else could you ask for???</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this to use in my Lenovo Y510P, which has a SD card slot that flush mount a card, so why not add some more SSD storage? I was considering the 512GB, but for the price, this was much better at the time (Mar2016). Mine benched a little better than the other posted, with 4k blocks I got 90GB reads and 64GB writes. On 8k blocks it was the same as the other poster.PNY has the lifetime warranty too, which is also a nice feature, especially with a card this size, it should be useful for years to come. It came formatted as FATex, but I switched to NTFS for my setup. I am going to use this as my Acronis Secure Zone backup space, so I don;t eat up any space on my primary SSD. Since the backups run at night, I won&rsquo;t need the 200+ MB writes of the main SSD. I am very happy, and I would buy another if this one ever went bad. But if it goes bad, I will always have the lifetime RMA, so &hellip;One other important thing to note: The Lenovo Y510P SD card reader is on the USB3 bus, I knew this because I tested the card in a Dell Latitude that only came with USB2, and the same card on the USB2 reader bus clocked in around 21Mb/S reads and writes, thus being capped by USB2. So, if you want to get the most out of this card, make sure your reader can support USB3 speeds. It might even read faster than 90Mb/s, but I will not know since I don&rsquo;t have a SD card reader on a PCI-E bus? I guess I could buy a PCI-E to SD card adapter for my Desktop, but I don&rsquo;t need it right now so I won&rsquo;t know anytime soon&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="good-performer">Good Performer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great in my economy class camcorder. No stutter when filming 1080p video. Copies multiple files ~ 20-50mb/s over the slow built in USB 2.0 interface (picture attached), and quite a bit faster than that when using USB 3.0 card reader. Worlds faster than my previous card which was an old 16gb class 4 from ~2010.The bubble pack/laminated card packing is a bit of a pain to open. Had to use scissors. Though, it&rsquo;s good that it&rsquo;s there, stops people from counterfeiting these cards, which unfortunately happens far too often.</p>

<h5 id="i-have-about-15-pcs-of-these-bad-boys-i-ordered-them-when-these-512gb-cards">I have about 15 pcs of these bad boys. I ordered them when these 512GB cards &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have about 15 pcs of these bad boys. I ordered them when these 512GB cards came out 2 years ago at around 400-450USD. Now the price is very reasonable, I place it in all my laptops / ultrabooks &ndash; so that I get an extra 512GB (actually 476GB usable) of extra space. In an age of ever shrinking laptops, with just one m2 512GB SSD, this card is a godsend.Couldnt be more happier.And I can verify that indeed the write speeds can approach 90 mbps. But on average, it hits about 55 mbps only.Still a great inexpensive way to expand storage of all my laptops.</p>

<h5 id="fast-and-recommended-card-for-digital-photography">Fast and recommended card for digital photography!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>FAST card!! I shoot real estate photography and will shoot 3-400 shots of a property (shooting 3 frame bracketed and in RAW). That&rsquo;s a lot of data. Swapping back and forth with an older 80 mg/sec card I can actually tell the difference in how quickly my buffer will clear so I can review and/or keep shooting. Also, when downloading to my computer for processing, the process seems faster as well which speaks to the read speed of the card. This card is at least tied for first in my opinion with the cards I&rsquo;ve used and it may just be a straight up winner. I don&rsquo;t do video so I can&rsquo;t speak to that but I would highly recommend this card if you are using a reasonably modern digital camera and shoot hundreds of shots at a time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="honest-review">Honest Review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There really isn&rsquo;t much to say about this SD card besides it&rsquo;s flawless. For the price, I&rsquo;d say I grab another one. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been stuck with my Sandisk 32 GB and I would run out of room while shooting videos. Not only that, but the upload speed to transfer the videos onto my computer was time-consuming. This little card here, did the trick by making time not the enemy. Upgrading to a 64 gb and also having a 32 gb card makes filming so much easier.Pros:- Price: $$- Faster upload speed- Shipping came early than expectedCons:- Can upload slow, depending how big the file is- Saves film within 12 minute intervals, I prefer 15-17 Minutes intervals. (Sandisk has 15 minute intervals)</p>
