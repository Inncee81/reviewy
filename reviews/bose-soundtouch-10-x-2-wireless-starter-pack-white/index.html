<h5 id="really-nice-sound-some-user-interface-quirks">Really nice sound; some user interface quirks&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bose describes the SoundTouch 10 as a &ldquo;wireless music system&rdquo;. While this is a fair enough description, anybody considering this device should be aware that you&rsquo;ll need an external control source (I used both an Android phone and Windows PCs [running both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10]) there is a definite hierarchy of wireless sources it prefers.First: the sound from this device is very good, and unless the rooms in your place of use are <em>really</em> large, this will provide big sound in most indoor room sizes. Some may find the midrange slightly too bright, but across a range of programming types (from classical to acoustic to hard rock), I found the overall sound clear and pleasing.The on-device interface and remote control is simple: power, source presets and volume buttons (plus Pandora thumbs up/down buttons on the remote). The face of the SoundTouch also has four subtle LEDs to indicate WiFi, Bluetooth, Aux and overall SoundTouch status.For users, the complexity is off the device, and appears during set-up and configuration.What the SoundTouch likes for sources:-Internet radio via WiFi-Bluetooth devices-Aux in (wired).-Some streaming services (Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio, Deezer users are good to go. If you use Amazon, Slacker or anything else, the SoundTouch 10 does not currently support those services).-An extremely limited selection of DLNA services. The Bose support site states that it is not fully DLNA compliant; it recommends WD MyCloud or Synology NAS products, and provides additional instructions for NAS devices from Iomega, Lacie, Netgear and Seagate (but not the Buffalo Systems DLNA NAS that routinely stream music from via other DLNA compliant devices). FWIW, the SoundTouch10 recognized my NAS resident DLNA music library, and streamed the content&hellip;but in a semi-intelligible audio output that confirmed the Bose statement of &ldquo;not fully DLNA compatible&rdquo;. Too bad&hellip;What you&rsquo;ll need to get it playing wireless content:-For streaming services or Internet radio: either of an Android/Apple phone or a Windows PC. The SoundTouch10 has no display for configuring these sources. You must download an app and you must create an account. While the Bose privacy policy permits &ldquo;pseudo-anonymous&rdquo; (Bose&rsquo;s terminology, not mine) configuration, some collection of information about your system and use will continue, but you&rsquo;ll lose information on updates. If you elect full functionality, you can imagine that the potential uses are broad.-If you are configuring the SoundTouch via an Android phone, you&rsquo;ll provide information in the WiFi network you want to connect to and then run through options to add content types. Inexplicably, if you are configuring via a Windows PC, you&rsquo;ll have to briefly connect the SoundTouch via an included USB cable to complete the initial configuration.If you are streaming via DLNA content via an NAS device, both the NAS and SoundTouch must be connected to the same network. Bluetooth connection was straightforward and quick (for both an Android phone and an Apple iPod Nano (7th generation).The SoundTouch application is satisfactory, but it has some quirks. Instead of an intuitive tabbed interface or obvious menu icon, many of the advanced functions reside under an &ldquo;explore&rdquo; label on the right side of the app that is not particularly intuitive. As you use the application to store sources, you can save up to six preset content streams, which correspond to the buttons on top of the SoundTouch and its included remote.Interestingly, the application offered options for wired Ethernet network connectivity; presumably this is for SoundTouch models <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> that live higher up the Bose food chain.The device arrives with a quick guide; the full 30-page user guide does not ship with the product, but available at the SoundTouch (.com) support site.</p>

<h5 id="mobile-app-linking-software-need-improvement-but-sound-is-great">Mobile App &amp; Linking Software Need Improvement BUT Sound Is GREAT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sound quality but I have found that the linking system with the mobile app is a bit tedious to work with. Every few weeks I have to relink the speakers with the app. About once a week I have a streaming issue where there are breaks in the sound as if the app/speakers are having a difficulty buffering the audio file (the files are downloaded and not streaming from the web and I do not have this issue with other speaker brands). So overall the speakers are great but Bose needs to improve their system linking technology/software. I do love the 6 buttons for pre-programming stations from my Spotify. I often just use these so I don&rsquo;t have to bother with the lousy Bose App. But then the music is only playing from one speaker. Overall I recommend getting them if Bose continues to improve the software.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-product">Love this product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this product. Consistent with BOSE quality. Come to find out that it works with Sirius/XM radio also. Originally was going to stream Sirius/XM from my phone app to device via Bluetooth. Turns out it can run directly from WiFi without using phone app. Only suggestion for improvement is some type of on-board display to determine &ldquo;what is playing&rdquo; without having to use the BOSE phone app to find that information. BOSE phone app does work well and is constantly improving.</p>

<h5 id="great-internet-remote-speaker-and-good-price">Great Internet/remote speaker and good price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I reviewed this product and gave it 5 stars. Since that review I have tried to contact Bose about purchasing a Bluetooth adapter for my other Bose product (Wave Touchtone lll system). Oh we&rsquo;re trying to contact Bose is a ridiculous experience. I&rsquo;ve called twice only to be put on hold for over 20 mins, the first time and for over a half hour the second time. I&rsquo;ve emailed them 3 times. There customer support is terrible. It seems once you buy a product they no longer think of you as important. I am totally frustrated with them.I previously purchased the Bose Radio/CD/Internet and loved it. I wanted to add a speaker to my upstairs study but didn&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of money for a remote speaker. Well I found the Bose Sound Touch 10 Wireless System for $200. It works as a remote speaker or a Bluetooth devise. The sound is great. It is easy to install. It takes up a minimum of space. I am well pleased with this product and it&rsquo;s performance.</p>

<h5 id="love-these-speakers">Love these speakers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love these speakers, great sound for size, and versatile. As advertised you can add additional speakers, and have same music playing in house or inside and outside(not outdoor speakers, but if protected, can use), or different music. Fairly easy to use app, to control music, and can use seveal different sources, such as pandora, spotify, etc. Can use bluetooth, or wifi, or even auxiliary to attach to your TV, etc. Highly recommend, and great price for what you get!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-form-factor-is-great-for-a-crowded-counter-tops">The form factor is great for a crowded counter tops</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The form factor is great for a crowded counter tops. I have several sound touch systems that are great, but the sound touch 10 only gets three stars after determining Bose chose not to include Apple airplay in this model. You can connect by bluetooth, but Airplay was so much more convenient and for whole home listening. My guess is Bose had to do this because of relationships with Pandora and iHeart radio services, the only two music services available in their app. Consequently, I would only purchase their older systems that have Airplay for my own preferences which removes the need for their SoundTouch app.</p>

<h5 id="it-is-a-beautiful-thing-occasionally-the-software-can-be-buggy">It is a beautiful thing. Occasionally the software can be buggy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>With a few taps on my tablet each night I am playing bedtime stories in each of my boys rooms from a USB drive on my router. It is a beautiful thing.Occasionally the software can be buggy, and it is ridiculous that Bose is still quarreling with Apple over supporting Apple Music or Apple Match. But aside from that this is perfect for parents being able to route bedtime audio to the kids.</p>

<h5 id="it-is-a-good-product-the-delivery-is-perfect-to-holiday-destination">It is a good product. The delivery is perfect to holiday destination &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a good product. The delivery is perfect to holiday destination while I&rsquo;m in the USA (I&rsquo;m french, came in vacation at my brother at Philadelphia and going to Myrtle Beach&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing">amazing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent sound quality, controlled by the Soundtouch App from your laptop, ipad, or phone. You can link multiple speakers as stereo/surround so they act as one unit, or have them&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-disappointing">Very Disappointing.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The sound quality, when it did work, was not what you would expect from Bose. It was very &ldquo;tinny&rdquo;.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<p>Sounds great. Set up was easy .have 2 of them</p>

<p>Sound quality is amazing &hellip; when it works. The remaining 90% of the time it repeatedly and intermittently cuts out and warps music - utterly maddening.</p>
