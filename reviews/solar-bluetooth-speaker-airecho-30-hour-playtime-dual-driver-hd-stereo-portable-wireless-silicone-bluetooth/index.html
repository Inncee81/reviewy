<h5 id="awesome-speaker">Awesome Speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I currently work in construction and having music is a must, but being outdoors means that we are exposed to harsh conditions.When I saw this speaker I knew I had to give it a try since everything else I had broke.Being rugged and water resistant is a must when working outside, that&rsquo;s the only way anything last over a week.This is not your typical crappy water resistant speaker, the sound is really good and it can get pretty loud.The passive bass is more then enough for what I listen to.I always clip a carabiner on it so I can just hook it on the scaffolding and have it close to me.Just the other day by mistake I dropped in a bucket of cement and I thought for sure it was dead, but I remembered that it was water resistant and rinsed it off, I was surprised that it worked just like new.The rubber exterior is great because I don’t have to be afraid of dropping it and breaking it like all the other speakers I’ve had.The battery is pretty amazing,it never dies, it always charges by itself so i never have to plug it in, it always works.Another cool feature it has it the hardware buttons that allow me to skip tracks and play/pause which means I don’t have to touch my phone with dirty hands.I love the blue rubber color on the outside, its very unique and eye catching.Overall I think this is a great speaker and if you work outside this is a must.</p>

<h5 id="just-in-time-for-summer">Just in time for summer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I love bluetooth speakers. I wanted one for camping and outdoor activities and this one really handles that role because it is solar. When it has sun access you can tell it is charging by the green light indicated on the battery symbol.The rubber case has a really cool texture that appeals to people that enjoy sensory stimulation such as myself.The sound is great. I have listened to it with a variety of musical styles and it hasn&rsquo;t had any distortion even at high volumes.The case includes a loop so you can attach it to your backpack or hiking gear to motivate the theme of your adventure.It has 5 buttons on the end: volume up/down, phone call button, power and flashlight button. The flashlight has 3 modes: on, fast strobe and slow strobe. Initiate the flashlight by double tapping.The solar panel does charge the battery as I could see by the charging light, but I haven&rsquo;t tested the claim of 30min of playback per 10 min of charge because I couldn&rsquo;t kill the battery. It has seemed to last a really long time.The rubber case has built-in rubber feet that make for slip-proof action on any surface.I can&rsquo;t wait to get outside to include this in my travels.</p>

<h5 id="great-solar-bluetooth-speaker-long-lasting">Great Solar Bluetooth Speaker!!! Long Lasting!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I took this out of the box and started using it right away for my backyard BBQ hoping that it would have some battery life in it and it did. I did not have time to charge the product before use and I do not have any outlets outside. So I depended on the solar panels. My BBQ lasted the whole day and surprisingly, the speaker did not fail on me. Assuming that it does not come fully charged out of the box, the solar panels did its job.The product was nicely packaged. It was also very easy to sync to my phone. My phone detected the speaker right away. This speaker has really good sound quality. I put the volume up to max and it was pretty loud. Some speakers I have tried out there that was bigger than this on max volume and it was not as loud as this.The quality of the device seems durable especially with the outside silicone layer to protect it from accidental drops. It is useful especially if you have kids at home who likes to toss things to the ground. This protection would definitely help with the impact and might save your speakers from dying. It also has a little flashlight which might come in handy at night which is a plus.It comes with several accessories such as a charging cable, audio cable, 2 Velcro straps and a carabiner. I find the carabiner useful so you can attach your speakers to your bag while hiking. The speaker has a slot where you can put the carabiner through. It also comes with a user manual for instructions.In conclusion, I highly recommend this product if you are looking for an outdoor speaker to last you an entire day without having to charge the device.</p>

<h5 id="very-convenient-bluetooth-speaker">Very convenient bluetooth speaker.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very convenient bluetooth speaker.Having a solar panel on a bluetooth speaker was such a great idea!I can go for an all day beach/park day and play music the entire time without worrying about saving the battery.Even when the battery is not charged, the solar panel powers the speaker enough to play the entire time.The sound quality on this thing is pretty amazing too!For the size you wouldn&rsquo;t think it would have much bass, but there is a good full tone sound from this thing.Of course I&rsquo;m not rattling windows, you can feel some punch and boom.Very easy to connect and use.Bonus that it takes calls too!Very happy with this purchase!</p>

<h5 id="this-product-is-working-as-expected-and-very-good-for-out-door-activity">this product is working as expected and very good for out door activity</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>my mum bought this one for me as she is a huge fan of solar thing and green energy, this product is working as expected and very good for out door activity. as soon as I got the product,I have started suing it, me and my mother was so exited to see this working condition and we are very happy with the product. as it is portable love the design and color, it has silicone wrapped coat to avoid scratches. This product is splash proof and shock proof, these are huge plus for me as I play basketball in rain quite often. I have tested this speaker it plays up to 30+ minutes with just a 10 minute charge, and with full charge it is 30+ hours, also this a solar product so it is easier to charge while playing out in sun. The Bluetooth speaker is compatible with all devices as we have tested with iPhone, Samsung and nexuses and LG phoenix 2 and we had no compatible issues another great plus is, it has Built-in mic for hands-free calls..over all it is a good quality product.</p>
