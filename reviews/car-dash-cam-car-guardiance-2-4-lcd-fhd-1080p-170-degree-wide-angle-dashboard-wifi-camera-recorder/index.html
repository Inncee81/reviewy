<h5 id="excellent-video-quality">Excellent video quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> The camera is easy to set up and the video quality is very sharp and clear. I think this is a great camera at its price range.Highlights:• Automatic recording function: The camera starts recording automatically as soon as you turn on the engine.• Loop recording: When the memory is full, it automatically deletes the earliest recording. This feature saves you time from having to delete the older videos manually.• Motion detection: You can setup the camera to detect a movement and starts recording as soon as a moving object is sensed.• G-sensor: When the system detects a sudden shock, it will automatically “lock” the video footage and protect it from being deleted by the auto loop feature.• Built-in WiFi: Simply download the app to view the live feed on your smartphone.• Micro SD card support: Up to 64GB.• Great video quality: 1080P, sharp and clear even during night timeThis is a great camera for commuters, truck drivers, taxi drivers, delivery drivers. Honestly, I think every driver needs one whether for preventing any post-accident legal headaches by recording the facts, documenting a road trip, or capturing unexpected events.</p>

<h5 id="really-nice-dash-cam-works-great">Really nice Dash Cam, works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I&rsquo;ve always wanted a dash cam for my car. I finally took the plunge and got one. And it is pretty awesome! I hooked it up in my car today (it needs a mini SD card, which it did not come with one) so I will need to get one of those if I want to be able to record. The camera itself is pretty tiny, but when I put in on my windshield, the wide range of it was amazing. It comes with a car charger, which I left it on to charge up so it&rsquo;s ready next time I go for a drive. I am excited to start recording as I drive and have a piece of mind if I ever were to get in an accident, there will be footage to show what happened!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worry-less-with-a-dash-cam">Worry less with a dash cam.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera itself is tilt-able, you can adjust it vertically for the best view angle when you position it on your car. Setup was quite simple, this is my first time dealing with a dash cam as well. It was surprisingly easy for a beginner like me. You insert the cigarette male port, and plug in the USB port onto the right side of the dash cam, that is also where the reset hole and the AV hole is. The box essentially includes a long power cord that which has an extra USB female port on it for charging.Another USB cable is included for data transfer, and two base adhesives are included as well. The two bases simply latch onto the design of the dash cam, and you can use its included 3M adhesive to attach the cam on your windshield.Overall, It is perfect for anyone looking to protect themselves and their family from any wrongful lawsuit that might occur. Video evidence and just the presence of a camera will keep people in line. It&rsquo;s a very useful tool in many circumstances. Great video quality with an app you can use to watch a live feed.</p>

<h5 id="nice-corded-dash-cam">Nice corded dash cam.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I&rsquo;ve never owned a dash cam before, but have seen so many videos of scenes caught on them that we decided to invest in one. This one has all the features we were looking for like motion detection, parking detection, auto start recording and more. It linked to my cell via WiFi fairly easily thanks to the manual. The app was downloaded easily enough once translated to English. It will record for periods preset by me, if it detects an accident. 3 minutes, 5 minutes or 10 minutes. It also records in night vision, as you&rsquo;d expect. The power cord needed to be pressed into the gap between the windshield and the soft frame across the top, then down the side, and beneath the dashboard so it could plug into the cigarette lighter socket. Videos we&rsquo;ve gotten from this dash cam are clear. We are happy with it and recommend it.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t too sure about putting a camera in the car but I absolutely love this! So easy to use and install. I had to wait for a micro sd card so I could use this but in the world we live in today it&rsquo;s definitely a great thing to have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but since this product has been great, I might as well to help others.The video quality is excellent, and the functions are easy to use after you play with it for a few minutes. I love the ability to download the video immediately to my phone. The camera sticks very well anywhere you put it, and stays. It is tiny enough to also hide behind a mirror. I also like the design, it’s not bulky and ugly.</p>
