<p>Love itI bought 9 pieces for our school International Community College computer laboratory in Ghana. It is beautiful and neat.I am hoping to get more about 11 more to complete the required number. I didnt use the stand because of the design style I wanted but the stand looks pretty solid.I will recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-quality-on-a-budget">Amazing Quality on a Budget</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This monitor completely shattered my expectations on what a budget monitor could provide for a browsing and gaming experience.During Black Friday, I originally picked up an Acer monitor for what I figured was a good deal. The monitor was a TN panel, and I had heard that TN panels typically have lower response times, allowing for less motion blur in gaming. While the Acer monitor certainly provided a smooth experience, the lack of vibrancy in the colors and the positively atrocious viewing angles made the experience very unsatisfying. I was even developing headaches using it due to the extreme brightness of the panel.After a few days of trial and error, and countless attempts at calibrations in an attempt to make the Acer panel work for me, I begrudgingly decided to return it. (Thank you to Amazon, however, for providing even more of the legendary customer service on one of the most headache free return processes I&rsquo;ve ever went through!) I still wanted to purchase a new monitor, so I started researching monitors in far more detail.That is where the HP 22xw comes in. In my attempts to calibrate the Acer panel, I learned that average response times aren&rsquo;t typically shown on specifications of monitors. The response time shown is generally the best gray to gray timing the manufacturer could produce. This means that monitors could be wildly different in actual use. The HP 22xw model claimed to have a best response time of 7mms, while the Acer panel previously claimed to have 5mms. This was my biggest cause for concern with the HP purchase, but let me just say&hellip;After a couple days playing even the latest new games like Fallout 4 and Witcher 3, I have noticed ZERO ghosting using the HP 22xw. My laptop display has minor ghosting issues, so I assumed IPS in general just wasn&rsquo;t the best for low response time gaming. But I was completely wrong! This panel, while it was a bit more spendy than the deal I got on the Acer panel, is one of the best purchases I have made. It was still a steal at the price point I purchased it at, but the quality of the monitor itself is extremely surprising.Now with that story out of the way, here are my pros and cons list for the monitor.PROS-Excellent colors. The colors are vibrant and I can easily edit photos on the panel without fear of losing out on too much color accuracy. The amount of options the OSD allows for, as well, lets you choose a bunch of color temperatures to suit your needs. And on the subject of options&hellip;-Tons of options in the OSD! One of the major downfalls of the Acer I had previously purchased was a lack of options on the monitor itself. The HP 22xw has close to 5x as many options to calibrate your monitor with! Very much appreciated.-Good viewing angles. As per most IPS panels, the viewing angles on the HP 22xw are great. While not as effective as my built in laptop IPS display, there are hardly any viewing angles I look at the monitor that causes any sort of degradation in image quality.-Well built design. The plastics used are hefty, and the stand itself, with its rather neat design, feels sturdy. The monitor is also quite a bit heavier than most LCD panels, which I think is a great indicator of quality. The monitor doesn&rsquo;t wobble very much, either.-Expectation exceeding response times. This one was major for me, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with how this display works in the response times department. TN panels will continue to have superior response times, but I feel unless you&rsquo;re looking to purchase a 120hz+ monitor for high FPS gaming, IPS panels are the way to go, especially if you can find them at such an amazing price as this monitor.CONS-Minor backlight bleed. With most LED back lit monitors, back light bleed can be an issue. But honestly, I can only notice it if I really try to. Not to mention the ambient light of my room has an impact on it, too. This is an extremely minor complaint, as most of my cons list will be.-Panel&rsquo;s bezel is quite visible. This isn&rsquo;t much of an issue for me since I don&rsquo;t plan on using a multi-display setup (seems excessive!), but I could see this being an issue for some people. The white version of the monitor has a white plastic border around it, and has a fair amount of unused black bordering the entire display.-Lack of VESA mount. Again, this is another issue that doesn&rsquo;t quite yet impact me, but I can see it being kind of an issue. However, in the instruction booklet for the model I received, HP has an adapter that you can buy for VESA mounting!That&rsquo;s it, really! This monitor has changed my perceptions on what a truly brilliant, smooth experience a wide screen IPS display can provide. It&rsquo;s a budget monitor that met and exceeded my expectations. Until I have a computer that is capable of blasting modern games at 120+ FPS, this 60hz IPS display is going to be a permanent addition to my computer desk. The colors are vibrant and gorgeous, the response times are more than enough to please my eye, and the quality of the materials used to make the panel itself are incredible for the price I purchased the monitor at.If you are in the market for a budget monitor that is sure to please all but the most demanding of consumers, grab one of these panels!</p>

<h5 id="best-bang-for-the-buck">Best bang for the buck!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the 21.5 inch version of this monitor due to space limitations on my desk. As soon as it arrived I unboxed it, I checked for any physical damage (none found), I attached it to a Windows 10 desktop computer, and I fired up my system. The monitor was instantly recognized by my computer, and it installed without problems. No dead pixels were found, and the screen appeared flawless.The images it displayed right out of the box seemed perfect, but I still installed the included calibration software just for the heck of it. After making some minor tweaks to better suit my old eyes, I can honestly say this monitor is great. The screen images are sharp and clear, the brightness and contrast can be adjusted to your own liking, and there are numerous other settings (sharpness, focus, centering, etc.) which can also be adjusted. It is additionally possible to save several different calibration schemes for different situations or users. For example &hellip; I have one setup saved for daylight use (higher brightness and contrast settings), and another setup for evening use (lower brightness and contrast settings).HP has included several preset calibration setups such as Text, Gaming, Technicolor (certified), and others, so unless you have very specific needs, or unless you are extremely picky, finding a setting you like should be as easy as pushing one button.Others have commented this monitor is not comparable to 4K monitors or Retina displays, and it certainly is not. This is a high-quality, full HD, IPS monitor at a bargain price. If you can afford (and need) a 4K monitor starting at $500.00, go for it. For myself &hellip; I say BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK!</p>

<h5 id="great-picture-quality-at-an-awesome-price-point">Great Picture Quality at an Awesome Price Point</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked from a laptop for the past 11 years and for the past 8 years a MacBook Pro. I usually notice how grainy, and dark a monitor is right away because I&rsquo;m used to the quality of the Apple laptops. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve been completely happy with a monitor. In the past I&rsquo;ve purchased 3 to 4 monitors for my home office, and business and was never satisfied with the quality of the display. I purchased the Pavillion 22xw in white and I love it it. It&rsquo;s bright with no glare and matches my Apple products even though it&rsquo;s HP. I was easy to put together and is pretty light in weight. I was expecting it to be a bit heavier.Concerns before I opened the box were: The cardboard tabs that close the box were pre-bent meaning it had been opened before by someone. It still had the safety &ldquo;new&rdquo; tape on the box as well, but the bent cardboard tabs were concerning to me. I took a picture of it just incase and will include them below. When I opened the box it didn&rsquo;t look like it was used or a refurbished item.</p>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect! I was amazed at the quality of these monitors being that I selected the based on the low price. The resolution quality looks better than on my MacBook Pro Retina at times. The stands are heavy duty and the monitors themselves don&rsquo;t feel like plastic junk. I am thinking about adding a 3rd one to my work station. I definitely would recommend this monitor, especially if you are hooking multiple together like me for video and photo editing.</p>

<p>I am not returning the monitor; I am reporting that the monitor floor panel does not snap to the stand hence loose. It could cause the monitor to fall if shifted.</p>
