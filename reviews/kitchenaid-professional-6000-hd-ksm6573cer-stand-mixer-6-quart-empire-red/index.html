<h5 id="q-a-compare-6000-hd-to-pro-600">Q &amp; A Compare 6000 HD to Pro 600</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This machine is a solid bang for your buck. The following is a chat session I had with a KitchenAid rep comparing this unit with the 600 pro. I got this unit for under $250 bucks, so it was a no brainer for me. Hopefully this can help some people out.UPDATE (12/2/2015) -One other very nice thing i just found out from Kitchenaid; the 6000 HD uses the exact same 1.3 HP DC motor as the 6500 models. The difference is that the 6000 is programmed to use less HP/Wattage.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Emily: Thank you for contacting KitchenAid! My name is Emily. I will be with you momentarily.Emily: Hello Mr. Anderson. How may I assist you today?D. Anderson: Hello. I would like to know the differences between the motors for the stand mixers (600 pro and 6000 HD). Are there any downloadable spec sheets for these? Also, where could I view and / or purchase replacement parts for the 6000 HD?Emily: I apologize, we do not have any spec sheets for our stand mixers. I would be happy to provide you with the differences in these models. One moment please.D. Anderson: ok, thank you.Emily: I apologize, do you have a model number for the 6000 HD?D. Anderson: yes, 1 moment&hellip;Emily: Thank you.D. Anderson: KSM6573CEREmily: Thank you. One moment please.D. Anderson: ok. also, is that model made by kitchen aid in the US facility? I cannot find it on the kitchen aid website.Emily: The Pro 600 has a 575 watt motor, a 6 quart bowl, and can hold 14 cups of all purpose flour. The KSM6573 has a 1.3 horsepower motor, a 6 quart tulip shaped bowl, and can hold 14 cups of all purpose flour. The Pro 600 is available in more colors than the KSM6573. The KSM6573 has a tulip shaped bowl so it does not have as many compatible accessories as the Pro 600.Emily: All of our stand mixers are manufactured in the United States.D. Anderson: I know the 6000 is rated to output 350 watts - and is DC power driven motor; but is the 6000 HD motor a larger motor than the pro 600?Emily: Yes, it is a larger motor than the Pro 600D. Anderson: where can I find a list of all replacement parts and compatible accessories for the 6000?Emily: I can provide you with the list. One moment please.D. Anderson: Thank you.Emily: You&rsquo;re welcome.Emily: Thank you for waiting. I have provided the list of all accessories compatible with the KSM6573 below.Flat Beater - Coated (no burnished available) W10401173GSpiral Dough Hook - Coated W10335442GWire Whip K5AWWKSM6573 Tulip Shaped Bowl W10177650GD. Anderson: Those are what come with the mixer when you purchase it, correct? there are no other accessories that can be used with it (like an 11 wire whisk, or glass bowel, etc.)?Emily: Yes, these are all included with the stand mixer. There are no other compatible accessories for this model.D. Anderson: Oh, one other question&hellip;Emily: Ok.D. Anderson: the 600 pro states on specs it is a direct drive transmission&hellip; is the 6000 the same? And are they also both all metal gears with metal gear box?Emily: Yes, the 6000 is a direct drive transmission as well. And both models have all metal gears and metal gear boxes.D. Anderson: Sorry, one other item I just remembered&hellip; The 6000 pro has 350 watts and 600 has 575 watts&hellip; Since the 6000 pro is DC driven motor and larger, does that mean it is the same or more &ldquo;effective&rdquo;, performance power than the 600? Does it have more torque on each speed setting than the 600?Emily: the Pro 6000&rsquo;s motor is more energy efficient, powerful, and will last longer.D. Anderson: OK, so it will actually be able to more efficiently &ldquo;muscle through&rdquo;, heavier mixes (like dough&rsquo;s\batters), than the 600?Emily: Yes, it is.D. Anderson: Ok, I think that is it from my end. Thank you for your time and information.Emily: You&rsquo;re welcome. Thank you for contacting KitchenAid. Have a great day!D. Anderson: You too. Bye.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-buy-this-proprietary-model-buy-the-600-pro-instead">Don&rsquo;t buy this proprietary model! Buy the 600 Pro instead.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be suckered into buying this because it&rsquo;s cheaper. After buying extra 6qt bowls and accessories, we discovered that this one is uniquely designed to not work with <em>any</em> other KitchenAid accessory. No beaters, no bowls. A KitchenAid rep confirmed that on the phone. And they don&rsquo;t sell any accessories for this unique design either.Such an utterly stupid design. You&rsquo;re stuck with what you get. It works, sure, but you&rsquo;re much better off to buy the 600 Pro instead as it works with the rest of the accessories.</p>

<h5 id="well-built-machine-with-serious-manufacturing-issues">Well built machine with serious manufacturing issues.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a well-engineered product, but the manufacturing process leaves something to be desired.When the first unit was received the stainless band, around the motor head, did not fit snugly against the housing. The gap, in the area of the sliding switch, would retain flour or other particulate matter and possibly cause premature switch failure.That was replaced with the second unit. Upon unpacking, the same stainless band was fitted even more loosely than the original unit. With the help of a friend (it took two sets of hands), we were able to get some improvement, but still had a gap above the sliding switch. Since this appeared to be a design defect, it was decided to try to overlook it and move on.Prior to use, the bowl was washed with hot, soapy water, rinsed completely, and dried, Then, the first batch of cookie dough was made in it. Nearing the end of the batch, the dough was removed from the sides of the bowl using a soft spatula. The first photo shows that dough. It was obvious that there was some serious contamination from the residual lubricant, or whatever, was used in the manufacturing of the bowl.After again washing the bowl, a Clorox wipe was used to &ldquo;test&rdquo; it&rsquo;s cleanliness. The second photo shows that wipe.For a product made to be used with edibles, this is of concern. Even though it is a solid piece of machinery, there are doubts about the manufacturing process and the possibility of contamination, in both the switch area and, more importantly, the interior surface of the bowl.The mixer works great, but you have to get past the other issues. (Had the first batch been a chocolate cake, the contamination would not have been visible and would have been consumed).</p>

<h5 id="not-a-good-version-of-this-machine">Not a good version of this machine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not a good version of this machine. Bought this to replace a professional 6000 I bought at bed bath and beyond 6 years ago. This one has a slimmer bowl area, so attachments like the ice cream machine bowl donâ€™t fit. It also does not come with a splatter guard, and the handle doesnâ€™t have the black grip. My wife used the machine once. She made dough. The dough hook stuck and could not be removed. Returned it with the dough hook still stuck to it, and bought a better quality machine at Costco with all the same specs as the professional we had before.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-baking">love baking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This KitchenAid mixer is absolutely wonderful. I use it at least once a week. I habe made bread, Pizza dough, cookies, mashed potatoes, all without any problems. I love the way it looks and performs. I would recommend this to anyone that bakes a lot. The bowel size is great for doubling or even making a triple batch of most recipes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beautiful-color-kitchen-aid-never">Beautiful color. Kitchen Aid never</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike other mixes, the body of this mixer does not lift up, you remove the bowl. Beautiful color. Kitchen Aid never fails</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-buy">Great buy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He is a professional chef, and he hated the mixer I had previously. I actually purchased a refurbished unit - about $100 cheaper at the time, and it still works wonderfully 4 months later. I think that speaks volumes to KitchenAid&rsquo;s quality; even the &ldquo;old&rdquo; ones are great! This mixer makes my husband happy, and the food he makes with it makes me happy. ;)</p>
