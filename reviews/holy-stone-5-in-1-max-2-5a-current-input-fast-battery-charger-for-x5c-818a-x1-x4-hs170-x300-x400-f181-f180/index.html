<h5 id="buyer-beware">Buyer Beware.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had purchased one previously, and left a neutral review stating that it works but the battery connectors are poorly made and you have to fiddle with it to make it work right. I was careful not to imply anything about Holy Stone as it was very inexpensive and after some tinkering it works, just not great. Holy Stone saw my neutral review and really pushed me to make an adjustment to my review and they offered to send out a free replacement. I simply asked that they made sure it worked and I would have been happy to amend my review. My replacement arrived, but it works even more poorly then the first one, and now I see my previous review has magically disappeared. Now I&rsquo;m mad&hellip; I get the distinct impression they care much more about image then selling a good product to start with. I&rsquo;ve wasted enough of my time on this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-as-difficult-as-some-say-good-little-charger">Not as difficult as some say. Good little charger.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many reviews stating this is hard to plug into. That is not entirely true. My syma x5c-1 factory batteries and my mudder after market batteries both make a good contact without having to be completely plugged in. It you are going to move the batteries around while plugged in, then I would recommend plugging them in all the way. If they are plugged in, then yes you will most likely need to use a small set of pliers to remove the plug.This charger is very small, about 1.5 inches wide. It does work very well while being plugged into my computer usb, the usb port of my apple wall charger and also my permanently installed usb/120v outlet.Each charging port has its own individual light which will illuminate when plugged in and turn off when charged.The USB cord is 21 inches long and it come with 5 plug in adapters for other battery types.I have attached pictures to illustrate everything mentioned</p>

<h5 id="updated-review-takes-a-man-and-a-boy-to-unplug-batteries">Updated review - Takes a man and a boy to unplug batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an update to an earlier review (shown below). I originally gave it only one star because if the batteries were plugged in until seated it was extremely difficult to unplug them. I have been able to use the charger by barely inserting the batteries until the charge light comes on, which works but is precarious as any disturbance could easily disengage one or more. So I have updated to two stars with this caveat. I have received two emails from the seller explaining that such a low star rating could hurt their business and they offered me a 50% refund if I would agree to change the rating to 4 or 5 stars, a business practice I find unethical.Bought so as to have more flying time with the Hubsan X4. It charges five at a time easily. I marked it down because it takes a small pair of pliers to unplug some of the batteries when they&rsquo;re charged. I hear/feel a click when they plug in but there is no release, just pull and hope nothing breaks. I managed to get three out tugging forcefully with fingers, the other two required help.</p>

<h5 id="nice-little-charger-that-does-the-job">Nice little charger that does the job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this charger a lot since receiving it a week ago and have no complaints. The connectors snap solidly into the unit so they won&rsquo;t dislodge during charging and the LEDs will turn off one by one as each battery becomes fully charged. As one reviewer mentioned they are very difficult to unplug once charging is complete due to their small size. I use a pair of small needle-nose pliers to gently grip the plastic connector and this makes removal very easy thus avoiding having to pull on the connector wires and possibly damaging your batteries.It&rsquo;s very convenient to be able to charge 5 batteries at one time since quadrotors discharge them so fast. I&rsquo;d recommend also picking up a dedicated USB wall charger to go along with this unit so that you won&rsquo;t have to use your computer&rsquo;s slow charging ports. USB2 ports on a PC will only spit out 500mA and even standard USB3 ports will only do 900mA, so if you are trying to charge 5 dead 380mAh batteries it will take well over 2 hours using a PC USB3 port and almost 4 hours on a USB2. I purchased the Anker 20-watt 2-port wall charger which can produce 2.4A per port and can fully recharge 6 dead batteries in only about 45 minutes.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LFL2JB6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1Combining">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LFL2JB6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1Combining</a> these two little gizmos allows me to spend more time flying quads and less time charging batteries.</p>

<h5 id="a-charger-for-your-hubsan-drone-batteries">A charger for your Hubsan drone batteries.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Updated: The charger worked fine for 2 weeks. Now it&rsquo;s undercharging my batteries. For some reason now the charging lights go off very easily. I connect all 5 ports and only 3 will be charging, then they go off very soon. All my batteries are undercharged by it. Now I have to use the stock charger to charge it one by one again. Not recommend it any more.If you have a Hubsan X4 like I do, this is a must-have item with multiple batteries. It comes with 5 adapters which I have no use yet. My Upgraded 500ma batteries connect directly to the box. The connection is not too tight, a little bit loose actually, but the cable won&rsquo;t come off unless you yank on it. The charging is fine. All 5 batteries got charged all at once. The red lights are bright and perhaps a little too much at night. Overall I am satisfied with this little helper.However, I have to reduce one star due to the tiny charger connection. It didn&rsquo;t go all the way in and part of metal sticks out, as you can see it from their picture. It makes the thing look poor-designed. I am wondering why they didn&rsquo;t just get ride of the tiny connector and just integrate the cable with the box. It will make it look better and save 1 cent or 2.</p>
