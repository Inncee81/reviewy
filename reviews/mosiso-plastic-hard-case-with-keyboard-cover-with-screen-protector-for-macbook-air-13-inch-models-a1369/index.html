<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="10-10-would-recommend"><sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> would recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very satisfied and pleased with how it both looks and feels. So simple. Case snapped right on and the keyboard cover fit perfectly. Would not change a thing.The case came in 2 days so I was happy to have the case before I even bought my MacBook. Will probably buy a few other colors. Also screen protector was a nice touch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-was-looking-for">Exactly what I was looking for.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Screen protector was easy to put on. Use a credit card to move air bubbles across the screen and you&rsquo;ll be good! Case fits snugly on my early 2015 Macbook Air and looks great. Love the colour!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-the-price-can-t-be-picky-for-such-an-enticing-price">Perfect for the Price. Can&rsquo;t be picky for such an enticing price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving it 5 stars because for the price, it&rsquo;s absolutely perfect. When you&rsquo;re paying $14 (less tax &amp; shipping if you don&rsquo;t use prime) I don&rsquo;t see much room to complain. It is just as I hoped for.The ShellAlthough mine did not come with directions, the installation of the shell was fair simple. The shell fits pretty nicely as well. The shell does feel a tad bit cheap but again, you can&rsquo;t expect super high quality practice for the price. At first, during the installation I didn&rsquo;t know if the top half of the shell was completely on but it was.Keyboard CoverThe keyboard cover fits very snug. Actually, if you want to remove it, it fits so snug that it&rsquo;s a little tricky to get off which I guess means it is going to serve it&rsquo;s purpose.Screen ProtectorI didn&rsquo;t install the screen protector because a. I&rsquo;m deathly afraid of air bubbles that I always get when installing a screen protector on my iPhone b. There&rsquo;s little direction as to how to install the screen protector c. This is the only true con I found but the screen protector I received did not completely cover the screen. It my just be a personal thing, but it would annoy me knowing that it does not go completely to the edges of the screen. And by screen I mean the desktop, not the entire top half of the laptop.OverallLike I said, for the price it is perfect. With simple installation and a sleek look, I have really no reason to give this anything less than a five star. If there was a four and half star option I&rsquo;d probably go with that but there isn&rsquo;t so I&rsquo;ll give them the benefit of doubt.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-improvement-from-a-speck-case">Nice improvement from a Speck case.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the camel color; it is a cross between blush pink and a true khaki color. Everything works perfectly and aligned and snapped on well. I previously had a Speck case that cracked and broke at the corners, I&rsquo;m hoping this one holds up better. I like the matte look and feel of this case better than the slick Speck case. I wasn&rsquo;t sure I was going to use the screen protector (I&rsquo;ve had my Mac for almost two years with no damage) or the keyboard, but gave them both a try and am very pleased with how both look and feel.</p>

<h5 id="i-m-sure-some-people-are-the-same-way-but-i-m-writing-this-review-so-the-people-like-me-don-t-have-to-do-that">I&rsquo;m sure some people are the same way but I&rsquo;m writing this review so the people like me don&rsquo;t have to do that</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m the type of person to research about a product for a couple days before purchasing it. I&rsquo;m sure some people are the same way but I&rsquo;m writing this review so the people like me don&rsquo;t have to do that! This is the second case I have purchase for my MacBook Air, the first one I purchased was the ibenzer brand. To compare: they are both very well made and too much alike to pick apart what&rsquo;s good and what&rsquo;s not. I would highly recommend either brands!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-and-want-more-colors">Love this and want more colors!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this case! Great value for the money. I have a 13&rdquo; MacAir so I followed the instructions to choose the right numbers and it fits perfectly. I love the color. It&rsquo;s a nice nude color that leans towards blush. Probably couldn&rsquo;t stand up to a hard fall because it is plastic, but I haven&rsquo;t had any issues with cracking. I keep mine out and use a soft laptop sleeve for when I travel and it&rsquo;s held up beautifully. Very happy with this purchase and I&rsquo;m already looking at other colors.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="simple-i-love-it">Simple. I love it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the simple one color it is. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting the silicone keypad ðŸ˜±</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-case-because-it-still-gives-my-mac-the">I love this case because it still gives my Mac the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this case because it still gives my Mac the sleek minimalist look, but now in my favorite color! I use my computer frequently since I do a lot of programming work and take my laptop everywhere with me. After 3 months of use though, all of the white &ldquo;feet&rdquo; on the bottom part of the case have fallen off (they were just glued on). Also, the keyboard cover has loosened and they keys that I use frequently have rubbed off (other keys look completely fine). I also just recently realized that the keyboard cover covers up the speakers, so music is slightly muted. Otherwise, the cover is very thick and opaque. Nothing else has chipped. I love how it looks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome product!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="4-9-stars">4.9 Stars!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this case. The color is exactly as described &amp; it fits great. The only downside is the keyboard cover does muffle the sound of the speakers a bit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits perfectly! Color is exactly what I wanted!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-the-keyboard-cover-as-it-is-not-too-thick">I love the keyboard cover as it is not too thick</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case fits on snug and it was simple to snap on. I love the keyboard cover as it is not too thick; my last one from a different company was a bit thick and hard to get use to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-color-but-when-the-bottom-part-of-the">Love the color but when the bottom part of the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the color but when the bottom part of the case is on it is very uncomfortable to type on my laptop. The edge is alway scratching poking at my wrist.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks awesome, fits great, no complaints.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="placing-on-computer-but-once-it-was-on-i-loved-it-it-s-rubber-like-feel-is-great">&hellip; placing on computer but once it was on I loved it! It&rsquo;s rubber like feel is great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had a difficult time placing on computer but once it was on I loved it! It&rsquo;s rubber like feel is great. I haven&rsquo;t placed screen protector but it was a great bonus.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-price-great-product">Great price, great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product, looks and feels great, the apple lights up and gives a cool blue soft light glow. Would highly recommend, will buy again in other colors.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nope">Nope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bottom broke and cracked after a few days.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the color and have received several compliments.</p>
