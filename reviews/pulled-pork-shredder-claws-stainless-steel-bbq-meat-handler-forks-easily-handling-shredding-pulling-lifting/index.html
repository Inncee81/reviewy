<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="awesome-claws">Awesome claws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these so I could more quickly make dishes that require shredded meat. It&rsquo;s timely to do with forks so I wanted meat claws that would more easily do that task. These have been wonderful. I love pulled pork but hate the mess of shredding. These stainless steel ones are sharp and heavy duty and so easy to use which made the meal that much better. I didn&rsquo;t want plastic so these were a no brainier for me. Easy to clean just a little soap and hot water and they looked like new again. Can&rsquo;t wait to try these next when i make shredded chicken enchiladas.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-even-for-shredded-chicken">Works even for shredded chicken</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I make shredded chicken all of the time for burritos. I use a slow cooker then rip it with a fork. I&rsquo;ve been seeing these everywhere but I didn&rsquo;t want to purchase plastic. They don&rsquo;t last as long as metal. I found these and they are perfect. The metal seems stainless steel the wood I believe is bamboo. Its an excellent product and I highly recommend it. Works very well for shredding chicken, I am sure pork will work just as well. These are very durable as well. Dropped them once or twice without killing anyone or breaking them so I call that a win.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="everyone-needs-these">Everyone needs these!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have got to say this is one of my best kitchen tool purchases yet!! I can finally shred up my roasts, taco meat, shredded chicken grab my meat from the oven without dropping it these sharp little tools have so many uses. The nice wooden handles are so nice and easy to grip. I no longer have to deal with burning my fingers trying to use forks pulling the meat apart or separating the fat or risk dropping it all on the floor. Well worth the price!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-cook-a-lot-at-home-actually-we">We cook a lot at home. Actually, we &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We cook a lot at home.Actually, we never eat out.Maybe less than 3 times a year.You get a pair of shredders, and they&rsquo;re well built.Was afraid they might eventually fall apart afteryears of pounding and shredding, but these seemsolid. Will update if anything goes wrong.The handle is wood, and the shears are stainless I think?Quite sharp. Don&rsquo;t leave where little kids can find them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="restaurant-grade-shredding-claws">Restaurant grade shredding claws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> These are true quality shredding claws, stainless steel and wooden handles, not plastic like some others we have seen. Restaurant quality product. We are going to get a lot of use out of these fine utensils. Please see video for a demonstration. You should consider getting a pair for your kitchen, they are well worth the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-kitchen-tool-ever">Best kitchen tool ever!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These claws work like magic! They make it extremely easy to shred meat. I&rsquo;ve used it on rotisserie chicken and carne asada so far. They are super sharp so make sure that you put them away in a safe place and keep them away from kids. The blades cut through the meat like its butter! Definitely will be purchasing a few more sets for gifts for the holidays!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="an-awesome-kitchen-tool">An Awesome Kitchen Tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got these for my husband for when he makes pulled pork sandwiches. He made a pork roast the day after these we delivered. He absolutely loves them. He said no more burnt fingers which made us both happy. He already had dinner done by the time I got home so I couldn&rsquo;t take a picture of them in action. I would highly recommend these to everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-must-have">This is a must have</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This item is a must have item for anyone who makes pulled pork, beef or chicken. The item is easy to use and works great with shredding the meat after it is cooked. The handles are made of wood which are stronger and you cant go wrong with the stainless steel claws. I have used other meat shredder in the past which have broken so I decided to try this one and I am very happy with my purchase.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I used two forks for so long.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-use-utensils-for-pulled-chicken-and-pork">Easy to use utensils for pulled chicken and pork</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The one thing I use to dread was making buffalo chicken dip from scratch. After the chicken was done it&rsquo;s always so hot you have to wait for it to cool to start pulling it apart.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-good-quality-and-should-be-the-last-set-i-ll-need">These are good quality and should be the last set I&rsquo;ll need &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Man these claws are beefy! Or porky depending on what you&rsquo;re shredding. These are good quality and should be the last set I&rsquo;ll need to buy.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="satisfied">satisfied</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First time I used just one of the claws to hold baked potatoes to slice them. Much easier than a fork, and worked very well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-purchase">great purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have always hated shredding meat, particularly chicken, with forks and my wife feels the same way. I bought these for her as a stocking stuffer and there are no regrets.</p>
