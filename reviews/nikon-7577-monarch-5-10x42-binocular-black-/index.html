<p>Style:10x42
Almost an ounce lighter than its predecessor and built with Nikon ED (extra-low dispersion) glass lenses, the new MONARCH 5 is a serious contender to be the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; binocular for any outdoor enthusiast. The MONARCH 5 delivers sharp, high-contrast views that are the result of a state-of-the-art optical system. Featuring Nikon&rsquo;s premium ED Glass lenses and Dielectric High-Reflective Multilayer Prism Coatings, the MONARCH 5 displays exceptionally accurate color reproduction and a clear, natural looking image. Each of its Eco-Glass lenses are Fully Multicoated to provide maximum resolution and light transmission. The MONARCH 5 binocular comes in black finish and is available in 8x42, 10x42 and 12x42 magnifications. It utilizes Nikon&rsquo;s high-eye point design to provide a clear field-of-view and long eye-relief. The long eye-relief ensures a sufficient space between the user&rsquo;s face and the binoculars&rsquo; eyecups to make them comfortable for everyone, even for those wearing eyeglasses. The turn-and-slide rubber eyecups make it easy to find the right eye positioning for extended periods of use. The MONARCH 5 also utilizes a smooth central focus knob that makes it easy to bring object into focus for fast viewing. Built for extreme usage, the MONARCH 5 is Nitrogen filled and O-ring sealed, making it completely waterproof and fog proof. A protective, rubber-armored coating strengthens its durability and ensures a non-slip grip during wet and dry conditions.</p>

<h5 id="lens-cap-explanation-and-overall-review">Lens Cap Explanation (and overall review)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a product designer, and as such, I like to inspect the quality of the things I buy and figure out why certain choices were made. It is my opinion that the eyepiece lens caps were made slightly large on purpose, not by mistake. The injection molding on them are too clean for it to be a mistake, and they&rsquo;re obviously too large for them to be designed with a snug fit. If you look in the instruction book, some of the first pictures in it show you how to attach the (included) neck strap and how to properly connect the lens caps to the strap. When using the binoculars as they&rsquo;re intended, that is wearing them around the neck, the lens caps stay in place quite well. When it comes time to use them, though, the lens cap easily lift off of the eyepieces and hand from the strap out of place. When you let the binoculars hang from your next afterwards, the caps fall over the eyepieces and protect them. Since they face upwards, having them protected helps ward off rain, debris, or sunlight shining directly into the lenses. If they were any more snug, they would not work in this way. Yes, it would be nice if they were a bit more snug, as it would make it easier to use them without the neck strap, but that&rsquo;s the way it is. I also wonder how much they&rsquo;d wear into the rubber eyepieces if they had a more snug fit. Sometime down the line I may design up and 3D print some more snug lens caps and will post the files online, so keep an eye out for those.Well enough about that, now on to the binoculars themselves. In a word, they&rsquo;re spectacular. I&rsquo;m used to some of the older and larger Porro prism binoculars or the smaller, cheap roof prism type. But regardless of style, I&rsquo;ve never looked through a nicer pair of optics.Before buying these, whenever I was out somewhere in nature, I&rsquo;d always wished I had some nice binoculars with me, and since I have a big trip coming up, I thought I&rsquo;d spend the money on a nice pair, and these blew me away. The very close minimum viewing distance is nice, as it makes looking at birds and squirrels a lot of fun. The long distance adjustment works very well, too. Looking past the optics, I wanted a pair that would be small enough to carry with me and won&rsquo;t be a burden (like while camping), but something large enough to provide good magnification. These are pretty much just the right size, as they&rsquo;re easily packable, but still large enough to feel good in the hand and have just enough weight to easily hold them steady. The rubber coating has a nice feel, and I think it should be able to protect them well. The objective lenses are set back enough that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about them taking damage if it bumps up against something flat. The objective lens covers are very nice and snap on tight. The tripod mount threading is nice, as securing it to something with legs really helps with stability.I am looking forward to using these more thoroughly on our trip and will try to post back about how well they work.</p>

<h5 id="i-chose-the-nikon-monarch-5-10x42-over-the-nikon-aculon-10-22x50">I chose the Nikon Monarch 5 10X42 over the Nikon Aculon 10-22X50</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Experts always recommend the more expensive binoculars, but I am always a skeptic, and need to see for myself. As a novice bird watcher, I&rsquo;m writing this in practical terms for other novices.I compared the Nikon Monarch 5 10X42 with the Nikon Aculon 10-22X50 (zoom) binoculars at a local store. Knowing that the optics of the Monarch 5 are better than the Aculon, I was still wondering if the 22X zoom and 50mm objective lens would magnify the subject enough to compensate for the inferior glass. I would say that, at 22X, the subject was about as clear on the Aculon as it was on the Monarch at 10X.However, the Monarch 5 has the following distinct advantages:1) At 10X, you have a much wider field of view with the Monarch vs the Aculon (96&rsquo; vs 66&rsquo; at 1,000&rsquo; range). Of course, as you zoom in with the Aculon, your field of view is reduced by more than half. Additionally, the Monarch presents a clearer image of the &ldquo;wider&rdquo; field of view. So when you are scanning for a subject, you are more likely to see it.2) To see the subject at the same clarity with the Aculon, you need to be fully zoomed to 22X. At that magnification, it is hard to find your subject, and once you find it, it&rsquo;s hard to keep the binoculars steady to get a good look at it.3) The Aculon is much larger and heavier.4) The Monarch can focus much closer. Even at 10X, the Aculon couldn&rsquo;t focus on anything within about 40&rsquo;. At 22X it was much worse. The Monarch could focus as close as about 9&rsquo;5) With the Aculon you generally have to find the subject at 10X, and then zoom in on it. It has a nice lever for this, but when you zoom in, the subject goes out of focus. When readjusting the focus, it&rsquo;s easy to lose the subject again. With the Monarch 5, there is no zooming, but you still see the subject just as clearly (just smaller).My only problems with the Monarch 5 are that the eye caps are loose, and don&rsquo;t stay on well. Also, while the binoculars have a nice neck strap, the case seems cheap, and has no strap (only a belt loop). The salesman said they are rugged enough to not need a case when using them, but I don&rsquo;t believe that. Glass is still glass, and it can get scratched. These are the only reasons for deducting a star.Of course, the Monarch is about $125-$175 more. So ultimately, you need to decide for yourself if these advantages are worth the price. For me, they are.</p>
