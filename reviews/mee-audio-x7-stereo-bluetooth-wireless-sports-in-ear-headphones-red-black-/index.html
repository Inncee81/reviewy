<h5 id="great-wireless">great wireless!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>good wireless headphones!I just got thee today and went for a bike ride. they stay in place very well! i use the plugs that were on it in the box (medium i guess?). It was a little weird at first putting them on as they see a bit different than regular ear pods, but once i put them on properly they are very comfortable and stay in place. They get pretty loud too. good bass and treble quality. sound is good!one note - when you pair initially, you need to have the headphones off, and then hold the button down for it turn on, continue holding until it says &ldquo;pairing&rdquo;. the directions make it sound like you need to hold it down after its on, and then it just keeps turning off.other than that little snag for a couple minutes these are awesome!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-sound-and-battery-life">Decent sound and battery life!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Decent sound and battery life! However, NONE of the three sizes of earbuds that came with the headset fit well. I wound up settling with a pair of earbuds from my Phaiser 730 headset. Also, when I chew, my jawbone loosens the headset and all of the bass disappears. Those are the reasons for only 3 stars instead of 4.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-but-has-design-flaws">Good, but has design flaws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sound is good, they also have a lower and smoother profile compared to other bluetooth inears ive owned, fit in th ear canal i pretty good too. I have a few issues though, I hate the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; that is created using the cord management clip, that must be redesigned. The cord that wraps around the top of the ear is way to flimsy which makes it annoying put on and adjust.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-they-felt-comfortable-and-did-not-fall-out-of-my-ear-at">and they felt comfortable and did not fall out of my ear at &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used them while on the treadmill doing a 3-mile run at about a pace of 6, and they felt comfortable and did not fall out of my ear at any point. As I moved to the weight area, I found myself wanting to skip songs, and change the volume, and was able to do both with no problem. My favorite feature is the ability to pause the song when I needed to talk to my workout partner, and I was able to do that a simple click of the button.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-much-better-than-what-i-had-expected">So much better than what I had expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After a number of review-reading sessions I finally settled on these. And you know what? They&rsquo;re one of the best purchases I&rsquo;ve made from online shopping. Very reliable Bluetooth, there has not been a single fault. They take approximately 20-30min to charge and l last you 7.5 hours I would say. Great for running or for your commute to work. I would recommend them if you want to move away from wired headphones!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality">Great quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These earbuds are soft and very comfortable to wear. They stay on and doesn&rsquo;t fall off easily during my workout. It was very easy to pair the Bluetooth earplugs to my iPhone. I could hear my music very clearly and it blocked out some of the outside noise. The battery life is long and 1 quick charge was able to last me for the entire day.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-only-it-works-perfect-but-also-it-makes-u-feel-comfortable">Not only it works perfect but also it makes u feel comfortable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this decent earplug so much! It is like an artifact. It is much better than any similar product i have ever purchased. I have never had any problems with it being kept inside my ears for a long period. I have referred it to other relatives!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-these-headphones">I love these headphones</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these headphones! It&rsquo;s Bluetooth and it can lasts up to 8 hours!! I use these when I&rsquo;m working out, so it&rsquo;s water resistent. You can adjust the volume on the right side and you can change the song also! It plays really clear audio</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Stopped charging within 3 months. Tended to skip even without obvious interference from large buildings. Never buy again</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-a-happy-camper">Not a happy camper!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Packaging like Fort Knox.I cannot get this unit to pair with my iPhone 5.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-for-the-price-everything-you-need-in-a-pair-of-bluetooth-headphones-and-nothing-else">Great product for the price; everything you need in a pair of Bluetooth headphones and nothing else</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fitting a decent pair of speakers, a long-lasting battery, a microphone, and a Bluetooth radio into a tiny package you can wear on your head is no small feat.</p>

<h5 id="good-headphones-for-running">Good headphones for running</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first set of Bluetooth excercise headphones. My main reason for the purchase is because my current ones doesn&rsquo;t stay in my ears during jogging. So, I bought this one.</p>

<h5 id="nice-headphone">Nice Headphone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first bluetooth headphone. The bluetooth connects fast and works very well. The earbuds were comfortable and stayed in the ear. Really good for running.</p>

<h5 id="sound-and-build-quality-very-good-at-decent-price">Sound and Build Quality Very Good at Decent Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They are fairly good headphones. They sound good, though they seem to be on the bassier side. Very easy to pair to my phone and yes, they do re-pair quickly.</p>

<h5 id="love-it">Love It !!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these Bluetooth headphones to use with some home video workouts in my apartment so that I could hear the instructions when I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily facing my laptop or&hellip;</p>
