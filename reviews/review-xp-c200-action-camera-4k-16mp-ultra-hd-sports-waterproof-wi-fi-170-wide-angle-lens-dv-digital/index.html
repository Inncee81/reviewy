<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="update-the-supplier-is-awesome">UPDATE - The supplier is awesome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this camera on July 14, 2017. I&rsquo;ve since written to the vendor for assistance, but&hellip;&hellip; zero response. There are multiple issues.1. The camera periodically hangs when booting. The only way to clear it is to remove the battery.2. The time and date reset whenever the battery is removed or swapped out.3. There is no image stabilization, so using it while in motion produces less than desirable results.4. Attempting to take photos with the remote fails just about 4 out of 5 times, even though the indicator lights on the remote flash.5. The remote also fails frequently with video capture. In addition, if you aren&rsquo;t looking at the screen(i.e. it&rsquo;s on your helmet), you can&rsquo;t tell if the video is recording. The lights on the remote work fine, but the camera fails to respond.6. Overall, when the video does record, the quality has been excellent. But if you move it too quickly, it will produce pixelation, especially when recording at 4K. Yes, I have a 64GB Samsung high speed micro SD card.The good? Lots of attachment goodies.Bottom line: I should have bought a higher quality product.UPDATE: The vendor had since responded and determined that I had received a defective unit. They offered to send me a replacement, free of charge. They also offered a 10% discount on my next purchase. Because I was having significant issues with image stabilization, I inquired about their 600 series camera. They offered the 10% off on the upgrade and fully refunded the original camera. Fantastic customer service. I&rsquo;m looking forward to testing the new camera.</p>

<h5 id="great-replacement-from-a-cell-phone-for-video">Great Replacement from a Cell Phone for Video</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for my son who has his own Youtube comedy channel, which has made a great change from his cell phone. Comes with a small remote which you can take a picture or video while being in the frame. Remote comes with strap so he can wear it around his wrist and not lose it. With it being waterproof he has been able to do videos in the rain. After he takes it outside he makes sure to dry everything. This comes with a lot of accessories many which he has not even used yet, as he does not do to may action videos. I personally love that this set contains two batteries this way he is never without a charged battery. Batteries seem to charge pretty fast and he gets lots of time with them, but this would be different for everyone depending how much you use it. He likes the soft case that comes with the set because it keeps all his stuff in one spot. Video is very clear and looks great on our 4k television. His Youtube videos also looks a lot clearer with the switch from his phone to this camera.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is awesome and so much better than I expected it to be. It&rsquo;s great that it comes with two batteries. The set comes with everything you need plus I can use my accessories to my other action camera on this one. I haven&rsquo;t used it with the water proof case yet but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be just fine. The picture quality is pretty good. And it has a display screen so I can see what shooting. I posted a few pictures I took in low lighting at the aquarium. I recorded a few 4k videos there but haven&rsquo;t been able to test the quality best I don&rsquo;t have a 4k TV. The app is great and easy to use. You pretty much need the app to connect your phone to the camera through WiFi. Using the app you can download tons of pictures in a few minutes. Most of the pictures I download are 2-3MBs and they transfered pretty quick. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with the quality especially for the price.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-everyday-moments">Perfect for everyday moments</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for an inexpensive camera to strap to my toddler and this is perfect! My mom was recently diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and we are currently living 10 hours away (soon to be 28 hours by flight), this is perfect to create compilation videos of my daughter&rsquo;s day to day activities to give her a piece of her only grandchild.The camera itself has a storage case that is the perfect size to easily hold and store the camera and all the accessories. The camera is easy to use and is actually intuitive (but the directions are very helpful as I&rsquo;m honestly not terribly tech savvy). The camera easily hooks up to wifi and video uploading is easy! If you&rsquo;re looking for an inexpensive way to capture life, this is great!</p>

<h5 id="this-is-awesome-i-think-go-pros-are-cool">This is awesome! i think go pros are cool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is awesome! i think go pros are cool, but this seems just as good. I have never used a go pro before. But this comes with so many accessories! and its easy to charge and simple to use. I haven&rsquo;t done anything crazy with it yet to test the durability but i&rsquo;m just excited to play with it. I really want to put it on my dogs collar to see what he sees out in the yard.I think this is a cool gadget, and if you&rsquo;re thinking of treating yourself to one, I think you should do it! and this one comes with so many accessories.You do need a SD card to record your moments on, but other than that, it pretty much has everything else.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fun-bargain-recommend-without-hesitation">Fun Bargain, recommend without hesitation!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have had so much fun with this little camera. Thrilled that we found it as the name brand one are just too expensive for us. It was a little intimidating when we first opened the case because there are many pieces but the directions were good so once we got it charged we were good to go. The remote feature adds to the fun so we could all be included in the shot. My only recommendation would be that the company should add a disclaimer indicating that it does not include a memory card. This was minor and does not change my recommendation one bit it just slightly delayed our fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="action-camera">Action Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is such an amazing value. There is everything that you need to start using this right out of the box. It even has 2 batteries so you can record for hours. It looks more expensive than it is, especially with the accessories. I am gave this to my daughter to use with her husband when they go out on their motorcycles. They actually captured an accident on it. The video was clear and the sound was good. It comes in a nice case to keep it in when not in use.</p>

<p>Pleasantly surprised with the quality of this camera. I bought this for my trip to Maui and was glad I didn&rsquo;t splurge for a GoPro when this worked great for what I needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="junk">Junk</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Takes decent photos but nothing compared to all the other action cameras out there. Another complaint is the camera freezes a lot when trying to switch modes.</p>
