<li><p>Weather Wear: Constructed with a durable and waterproof nylon and equipped with four hooks to hang anywhere; packaged with two micro-USB cables for added convenience</p>

<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>Give a kiss goodbye to power sockets and embrace the power of the sun. The RAVPower RP-PC005 is a solar powered portable charger that utilizes the sun&rsquo;s rays to charge your smartphones and tablets.</p>

<p>Constructed with our premium SUNPOWER solar charging cells that have an increased charging efficiency of 21.5% - 23.5%, you can power your portable devices from sunrise to sundown whenever you are outside.</p>

<p>Light and Portable
Chunky and cumbersome solar chargers are a hassle to carry, set up, and use. For something much easier, this 26.4 oz (754g) solar charger is half the size of similar chargers yet capable of generating just as much energy without the extra baggage.</p>

<p>Charge Smarter
iSmart technology automatically detects and delivers the optimal charging current for any connected device, ensuring the fastest and most efficient charge. When under direct sunlight, all three ports are individually capable of reaching 2.4A; with a total of 4.8A being reached when all three devices are simultaneously charging.</p>

<p>Power for All
Having an option for more than one USB port can result in an uneven distribution of power where one device charges faster than the other. With our built-in Smart IC chip, the flow of energy is regulated resulting in every device charging at an even and constant rate.</p>

<p>Hang It High or Lay It Low
Whether you&rsquo;re placing it on the ground, stretching it across a tree, or hanging it off your backpack via the four stainless steel hooks, as long as it&rsquo;s directly under the sun, your devices will charge. When outside and the elements suddenly turn on you, the waterproof nylon covering protects the solar panels while the pouch ensures your devices stay dry.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s In the Box:
1 x RAVPower 24W Triple-Port Outdoor Solar Charger
4 x Stainless Steel Hooks
2 x Micro USB Cables</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="excellent-charger">Excellent Charger!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Short Review: Wonderful Solar CHARGER that will quickly charge 3 devices at once.. I quickly charged 3 battery banks with this charger today and within a few hours all where 100% charged.. One of the battery banks is a Goal Zero Venture 30 which is a 7800mAH battery bank. Another is the Griffin Outdoor 10,000mAH battery bank and the smaller one is just an inexpensive 2500mAH bank.. On a sunny day in TN, this charger had no issues fully charging all the banks AT THE SAME TIME in under 5 hours.Tips: Before I get into the rest of the review, let me share a few &ldquo;Solar&rdquo; &ldquo;Tips&rdquo; with you1.) While you can charge your devices such as phones and tablets from the solar panel itself, I recommend charging power storage devices like I did in the photos.. Two reasons for this.. Depending on external factors, this charger might not always offer enough power to charge your high usage device.. And second, its not good for your phones to stay in the sun all day2.) Remember, weather (Even on sunny days), time of day, location, and other factors will affect output wattage.. I always recommend that a buyer only expect a charger to charge with ON AVERAGE half its capacity.. So with this charger, I expect it to average 12 watts on good days. I have received as much as 18 watts from this charger but it does only average 12 watts but that is standard!Pros:1.) Very HIGH output! - I average at least 12 watts out of this charger but have hit as many as 18 watts.. This is fine and is actually EXCELLENT from a charger of this size! Don&rsquo;t expect 24Ws all the time, it will never happen even with $1,000 chargers2.) Wonderful BUILD Quality3.) 3 USB ports - Most of these chargers on the market only have 2 ports4.) RACPower offers excellent support5.) The pouch that houses the USB ports seems to be waterproof - It has a DWP coating on the inside!! Excellent6.) Simple to useOverall: Great charger!! I love it and highly recommend it!Notes: Its hard to see in the photos that the devices are actually charging (Its BRIGHT OUTSIDE) but if you look closely all three devices have a charge indicator light onREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="i-was-told-it-works-great">I was told it works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this solar charger during the hurricane season as a back up measure. I have not used it yet. I also sent one of these that had a 2 USB to Puerto Rico to a family. I was told it works great!</p>

<h5 id="love-it-it-does-everything-that-it-says-it">Love it. It does everything that it says it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it. It does everything that it says it does and has been durable, was kicked several times under my seat while on a car trip. I probably got the last one because it came looking a little used but I was going camping so it didn&rsquo;t really matter to me.</p>

<h5 id="nice-charger-solar-charger-for-those-desperate-times">Nice charger solar charger for those desperate times.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a nice product, there are a couple of things I had wrong about this product that were initially assumed and proved to be wrong that would have been nice, I thought this would store some type of charge, but it doesn&rsquo;t there isn&rsquo;t a battery inside of this being charged up, therefore there isn&rsquo;t an indicator on charge left because this is charge as you go. When I got this I thought it was and immediately thought it didn&rsquo;t work or I needed to turn this on, customer service was very responsive and let me know there isn&rsquo;t a battery attached to this it is a straight solar charger. Once I realized that it started working, I tried it in a couple of different scenarios to see how it would work. I like to use the app Ampere to determine the actual charge I am getting. My first test was to use it indoors against a window, the charge I got was 440 mAh charge on my phone, which is slow but not too bad, when I plugged in my iPad, it wouldn&rsquo;t even recognize the charge because it was so low. Second, I tried outside my office in the sun, but not pointed at the sun, and I was getting a 660 mAh charge, and my iPad recognized the charge and was able to charge. Next I was directly in the sun light and the charge was showing 1010 mAh, (when I plug my phone into a 2.4 A wall outlet the max I see on my phone is 1020 mAh) but when I plugged in my iPad and my phone, the phone showed the charge dropping to only 220 mAh and the iPad didn&rsquo;t show any charge at all, so I didn&rsquo;t have a problem charging one device at a time, but I didn&rsquo;t have any success at all with 2 devices, or at least a phone and an iPad. I also tried charging my iPad a little later in the evening and with the cloud cover, I was still getting a charge, and when I opened this up in my car, I was showing a charge.This comes with the charging cables and 4 carabiner clips, and spots to put them, I think they would be useful, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure how I would use them. I tried hooking them to my backpack and it looked strange, but if hiking during the day this could keep your phone easily charged, or on a picnic or at the beach. Any outdoor situation this would be great to charge any device.This is a very big solar panel, these pictures are with a 9.7&rdquo; iPad, it isn&rsquo;t an iPhone or iPad mini, it is the full size, so you get a perspective of the size of this, it is big. When it is folded up, it is about the size of a 9.7&rdquo; iPad, so it is a good size, this is a nice emergency charger. I am particular when giving my reviews and they mean something to me. I think this is 4 stars because I couldn&rsquo;t get enough power to charge more than one device at a time, so it is a like (4 stars) not a love (5 stars).UPDATE: The first one I got was defective, RAVPower sent me another charger and I was able to charge more than one device at a time.READ MORE</p>

<p>I had a dead cell phone and a dead extra battery on a 10 day class kayaking trip. One of my classmates had this charger and another had another brand solar charger. Best product testing ever! The &ldquo;other brand&rdquo; took 4 hrs to charge and only charges 1 device at a time&hellip;lame! This solar charger charged my phone along with 2 others in a little under 2 hours! The owner of the charger clipped his solar charger to the front of his sea kayak to charge his cell phone. The solar pannels are rugged and there was no damage to the phone or charger. I was extremely suprised! So when I got home, I ordered this one and absolutely love it! I&rsquo;ve recommended this sweet gift from little baby Jesus to all of my friends. Mostly so they&rsquo;ll stop using mine and get their own.</p>
