<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-protection-but-be-patient">Great protection but be patient</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used Zagg&rsquo;s Invisible Shield for a long time and this product is almost exactly the same. If you haven&rsquo;t applied this type of skin on a device before, prepare for some headaches. It really takes patience and attention to detail to get the fitment right, especially around the speaker grills on the iPad Air 2.The trick is to use the included spray liberally. This will prevent fingerprints and will allow you to position the shield before final application with the squeegee. For the edges of the skin, use the warmth of your hands to work out the spray until the adhesive begins working.It took me over 30 minutes to apply just the back, which is quite a long time but the fitment was just perfect. There were some micro bubbles under the shield but they disappear after a day or two. Just be sure to work out the big bubbles when the skin is still wet, otherwise you&rsquo;ll have a nightmare on your hands.I didn&rsquo;t apply the screen protector because I don&rsquo;t like how it feels to the touch. A glass shield would feel better but would cost many times the price of this full body shield. Overall, it&rsquo;s a great product but be patient when applying it.</p>

<h5 id="armorsuit-military-shield-ipad-air-2-screen-protector">ArmorSuit Military Shield ipad Air 2 Screen Protector.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No this is a screen protector. I have this on my Gear watch. This is so much easier to apply then those ballistic glass ones. With this, you just clean your hands and screen and then spray the screen and the back of the film to make it easier to maneuver around. It might take a few tries but once it is in place for a minute or so, you squeegee the bubbles out. Then let it sit for 24 hours to completely dry. My only concern is the film for the back of the tablet. It is much bigger and you would have to fold it over and trim it. I left mine off since I use a cover for the tablet. Highly recommend this over the other ones unless you are an expert of not getting air bubbles or dust specs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-then-expected">Better then expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was expecting a thin sticker, which I am okay with. I just wanted something to cover the back to protect it from scratches without adding weight and I could still use a case without removing it. All of my expectations were meet except it is a stronger plastic then I thought it would be. This product has a sort of rubbery feel to it. As with any of the sticker protectors it took me a couple time to line it up so that the top and bottom were correct. It is very hard to rub the air bubble out, I found it easier (an acceptable) to use a straight pin and poke a hole in the sticker. I was then able to press the air out and get the sticker to attach to the iPad.Used on the iPad Air 2 (6th Gen)I have been able to use the Apple Smart cover, a generic smart cover and place the iPad into case that covers the back with the shield on.I only applied the back shield as I already have a front shield from another manufacture.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-good-start-so-far-so-good">A good start, so far so good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just have the ArmorSuit Military Shields installed on the new iPad, since I am not for a big protection case over a small tablet, which make the carrying impossible for small people. I used to be happy with zagg&rsquo;s product, but they must have changed the glue after I got my first two replacement. The new one does not adhere as tight as the old one. So I decide to switch to this one since the review and the price are great. The front shield is thinner than the back shield, which I think is just perfect for what I needed. The shield in the back eventually wrap around the rounded corner flawlessly, after some smoothing and pressing, I am happy with what I see on the finished product. So far, I am satisfied with the finishing, as for how well the glue work, it will still take years to decide</p>

<h5 id="simple-to-install-with-a-sleek-clean-look">Simple to install with a sleek clean look</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I dreaded installing this before I received it, but I followed the instructional video and I&rsquo;m really very pleased with the results. I&rsquo;ve only installed the back protector and it was easy with no bubbles at all and a very clean look. Unless you examin my device carefully, you won&rsquo;t know that it has a back protector.I wanted to keep my Air 2 as thin as possible and only use a simple sleeve to carry it. This allowed me to achieve that. Make sure to view the installation video before installing. Highly recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="another-fine-product-from-amorsuit">Another fine product from AmorSuit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Another fine product from AmorSuit. This must be my 8th orders from Armorsuit. I use this for all my tablets and phones. Bare in mind that I did order the full armor, but I only use it on the back for all my devices. I never like the feel for the front. But I do for the back. It also helps from sliding in my car with this Armor on. I used to use Zagg, their customer service is horrible and rude, plus why pay more. And no, I don&rsquo;t work for ArmorSuit and they did not pay me for this review. I am just another happy customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="impressive">Impressive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just finished placing this on my iPad Air 2. It&rsquo;s much better than I thought. Using a hairdryer to round off the back edges and corners was the trick. Patience rewards. No bubbles on the font (where I didn&rsquo;t use a hairdryer). It seems to me the hairdryer is more to dry the iPad and screen protector than it is to warm the screen protector. When it&rsquo;s dried out it&rsquo;ll stick to the iPad. I&rsquo;m using this on the back in lieu of a case: why add more bulk to the svelte iPad. I&rsquo;ve got a nice Timbuktu sleeve for more complete protection. We&rsquo;ll see how the front performs.This is very similar to original screen protectors by Zagg. Both companies advertise that they&rsquo;re for helicopter blades and fighter jets. Ok. I liked the original Zagg product. More recent ones haven&rsquo;t been as good in my opinion. Power Support makes a better product than Zagg, but thought I&rsquo;d try the ArmorSuit this time. So far, I&rsquo;m impressed.</p>

<h5 id="horrible-consider-a-differnet-brand-and-product-product-claims-are-inaccurate-and-pain-to-install">Horrible, Consider A Differnet Brand And Product. Product Claims Are Inaccurate And Pain To Install!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Extremely hard install, sides did not want to stick&hellip; front proctor is not scratch proof or resistant, scratched rubbing out bubbles and the scratch stayed, hasn&rsquo;t gone away. Screen protector diminishes image quality dramaticly.Horrible product! Never will buy this brand again. Had to order a different brand tonight.</p>
