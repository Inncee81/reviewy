<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="i-am-glad-i-bought-this">I am glad I bought this.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I did three years of research before I bought this telescope. I needed some thing suited for a first timer within his budget. I read several reviews about this telescope before I put an order. First couple of days after I received it, it was just a frustraion because using a telescope requires lots of patience and some practice (to be able to see something interesting). Now, me and my family enjoy this very much. Through practice, I can now locate and see moon&rsquo;s craters, saturn&rsquo;s rings and its moon (Titan), and jupiter and its four moons. If you are a first time telescope buyer, this is the best one to start with for less than $400. However, before you buy one, research about sky, constilations, stars, planets, and best time to view them. If your expectation is realistic, buy this. If you want to see Neptune&rsquo;s land scaping, forget about any telescope; just go visit NASA web page for high resolution pictures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-scope">Great scope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Before buying this scope I read all the reviews even though this scope a some negative reviews I decided to buy it anyway. I am honestly very happy with this scope I can see how someone impatient can get frustrated with it but if you do not have patience then astronomy is not the hobby for you. Given that do not expect Hubble like images from this scope but I live about twenty miles out side of the city and so far have been able to see the orion nebula, lagoon nebula, M57 (the ring nebula), galaxies M81 and M82, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Venus , and the Beehive cluster. I personally am very pleased with the views from this scope but the max magnification for this it is about 150X. given that you will almost never be able to use the 5 mm eye piece mainly because of seeing conditions just aren&rsquo;t good enough. So I recommend getting anywhere from a 25 mm to 10 mm eye piece to add to this scope other than that this is a good scope and will show you some amazing thing in our universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-scope-1">Great scope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have absolutely zero background with telescopes but was able to get this one together and take a nice look at the moon. Out of the box, it was straightforward to assemble. Because it was already dark, I didn&rsquo;t take the time to align the little finder scope but I still managed to focus the big guy on the moon and a few stars. The view of the moon was pretty solid, in my opinion.When viewing planets and stars - even using the highest magnification objectives included - the scope vibrates unless you are very still (and maybe hold your breath) so the image bounces wildly. Also, the stars don&rsquo;t seem to magnify to a size that is really more interesting to view through the telescope than they are with a naked eye.On another good note, this scope makes it very easy to track a star across the sky as the Earth turns. It only requires the turn of a single knob.Basically, I think this scope is fairly solid given the price. I&rsquo;m sure I could spend 10X the money and get almost everything I could hope for from a telescope but I&rsquo;m happy with this one.</p>

<h5 id="successful-christmas-present">Successful Christmas Present</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband chose this telescope after many months of deliberation and he is very happy with it - although it&rsquo;s taken a bit of time to set up - and of course you have to have the usual &ldquo;add ons&rdquo; like a moon filter and a night torch - then come the extra lenses - etc. etc. it would have been nice if you got a bit more of a friendly book when it came to the setting up - what it said wasn&rsquo;t wwhat the handset actually said - but we might have worked it out now !!! Very good product and excellent service as always from Amazon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-first-telescope">Great First Telescope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it &ndash; and so does the whole family. The views of the moon have been absolutely spectacular &ndash; it is the first time I have seen individual craters with my own eyes. We&rsquo;ve also gotten glimpses of Jupiter and Saturn &ndash; glimpses only because of high winds and some thin high level clouds.A couple of notes. If you want to look at the moon, you&rsquo;ll need to get a filter. It makes all the difference in the world. I never thought the moon could be too bright, but with this telescope it is.The telescope was relatively easy to assemble, but the instructions were confusing because the written description did always match the photos.If you&rsquo;re a novice stargazer, I highly recommend this telescope..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-telescope">Great Telescope!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this telescope about a month ago and it was my first telescope ive bought so I was a little scared. Everything came nicely packed and got it set up pretty easy with a youtube video&rsquo;s help. So far I love it I haven&rsquo;t had any problems with it, the stand is probably the only thing that could of been better. I also ordered the accessory kit and that made me love this telescope even more!..I recommend this telescope to someone who is buying a telescope for the first time. Ive seen sirius,rigel,Jupiter and its spot with the moons and now im waiting for saturn to show itself lol..</p>

<h5 id="given-as-a-gift">Given as a gift</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this telescope for my son for his birthday. We had been to an astronomy demonstration at Cherry Springs State Park in Pennsylvania. The kids really enjoyed the lecture and the views through the telescope. With my son&rsquo;s birthday approaching we decided this would be a good gift.Assembly was fairly straightforward and took less than an hour. I did need to call the support line and the analyst who answered my call was courteous and knowledgeable. The skies were clear that night so we took it outside and viewed the moon. It was easy to set up and align with the moon. The details were sharp and the kids really were excited to see such detail.I&rsquo;m hoping this continues the kids interest in the sky and science.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stay-away">Stay away</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled by the price of this telescope. This telescope is very cheap. The only thing I liked about it is a tripod - it is sturdy and well built.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-scope-great-price">Good scope, great price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would recommend this product to all star gazers. Set up wasn&rsquo;t to bad and the first view we got of the moon was amazing!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-really-in-love-with-this-telescope">I really in love with this telescope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>to be honest I&rsquo;m really, really in love with this telescope has met all my expectations. thanks you all for this great product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-complaints">No Complaints</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this as a present for my dad who is an amateur enthusiast and so far he loves it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-telescope-1">Great Telescope.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very good telescope, but definitly not a great one, you get what you pay for. But this fits my needs for now.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-for-the-money">Works Great for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wish the dials would be more sturdy. They seem as if the metal will wear out from turning. Great entry level telescope though. I enjoyed seeing the moon up close again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beautiful">Beautiful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This telescope is awesome. Gskyer makes the best stuff when it comes to telescopes. just as described, in gskyer packaging.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great value for the price could use a stronger EQ mount but aceptable for price, nice finish and good optics</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow">wow!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>wonderful. meets expectations 100% my son loves it and we star watch nightly. somewhat hard assembly but really easy use.</p>

<p>After a skeptical purchase, my worst fears were affirmed. I had hoped this was going to be a good product after reading so many good reviews, but I&rsquo;m not so sure that the reviews&hellip;</p>
