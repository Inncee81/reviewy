</ul>

<p>Formulated For Effectiveness</p>

<p>Let The Quality Of Your Liver Cleansing Reflect How Healthy &amp; Free You Want To Be </p>

<p>Detoxification is your body’s natural process of removal or neutralization of toxic components from your blood, organs, and cells. Your body processes these toxins through your liver, kidneys, urine, stool, sweat and breath (exhalation).</p>

<p>Cleansing is the action of supporting your body to carry out its detoxification more effectively.</p>

<p>Each of us has an individual tolerance level with regards to toxins. When we reach that level, a variety of problems may appear.
Imagine for a moment that your body is like a glass of water. When the glass is completely full, but you add more water to it, it will overflow. If you add more toxins to your body, but your body has reached its tolerance level, the toxins will not be processed anymore, and you might experience negative symptoms, even diseases.</p>

<p>It is a very good idea to do regular cleansing, and the liver is great for that, because the liver transforms detrimental toxins into compounds that can be cleared of safely. </p>

<p>Dr. Tobias Liver has been developed with the goal to help you with that in the best possible way.</p>

<p>We have called it a 21 Day Essential Cleanse because we basically recommend to take it for at least 21 days. </p>

<p>However, if you are ready to support your liver health consistently - then take it on an ongoing basis, every day. Your liver will be very happy. </p>

<p>Liver Support Every Day</p>

<p>Dr. Tobias Liver: Harnessing the Power of Plants&rsquo; Chloroplast</p>

<p>Formulated to
Help cleanse and help repair your liver
Aid digest multiple kinds of proteins and fats
Support your natural detox process
Dr. Tobias Liver is a very effective formula, built around a proprietary ingredient, Solarplast, and combined with an excellent combination of herbs and enzymes with the goal to help cleanse and help repair the liver.</p>

<p>The aim of the formula is to help counteract the effects of free radicals, the harmful by-products of oxidation damage to the cells in the body, caused by such hazards as pollution, UV rays, smoking, poisons, and poor diet as well as normal metabolism. </p>

<p>Free radical damage may result in countless potential health issues and apart from the almost impossible task of avoiding all of the causes, one of the best defensive measures is to take antioxidants — which are molecules that can help inhibit the oxidation of other molecules.
The Perfect Cleanse &amp; Support for the Liver, for Men and Women</p>

<p>Let your Liver Smile. With Dr. Tobias Liver
Let Your Liver Smile. Every Day. </p>

<p>Dr. Tobias Liver is
Fortified with Solarplast, which is organic, raw, and Kosher
Made with Artichoke, Dandelion, Milk Thistle, and the enzymes Lipase and Protease
Non-GMO
Vegetable Capsules 
Supply of 63 Capsules for the 21 Day Essential Cleanse
Made in the USA</p>

<p>Our Built-in Raw Super Ingredient Solarplast is a super antioxidant and provides high concentrations of energy molecules. Solarplast is an organic plant based material, which is enzymatically enhanced by a proprietary manufacturing process. It harnesses the power of the plant’s chloroplasts to provide a rich source of molecular chaperones and antioxidants, all in a naturally occurring lipid protective coating.</p>

<p>Globe Artichoke has been added to support a healthy liver and gall bladder function. The artichoke plant belongs to the thistle family, and much like milk thistle, it greatly benefits the liver. The natural components in Artichoke help stimulate the production of bile which acts as a sort of natural “detergent” working to transport toxins out of the liver.</p>

<p>Dandelion is popular, and widely recognized as a liver tonic as it helps nourish the liver. The potential benefits from the naturally-occurring triterpenes, sterols and flavonoids found in Dandelion Leaf Extract make this herb an important part of our product. Bitter resins that occur in Dandelion help stimulate the digestive system and help rid the body of toxins.</p>

<p>Milk thistle extract: The active component is called silymarin, which is nature&rsquo;s own liver supporter and the the focus of double- blind studies conducted to determine potential benefits of the herb on liver health. Silymarin is also a protective antioxidant.</p>

<p>Protease and Lipase, two key metabolic enzymes, are included in Dr. Tobias Liver because of the role they each play in proper liver function. Undigested fats and proteins in the colon are not desirable and Protease enzymes can help digest the proteins in the stomach and small intestine where the small peptides and amino acids can be absorbed. Proteins however that remain too large to be absorbed in the small intestines move on into the large intestine and there they become food for the bacteria. Some of the products of the bacterial digestion are potentially toxic. </p>

<p>Lipase enzymes are essential for digesting fats and oils. As with proteins, undigested fats in the colon can be associated with negative health issues. The fatty acid profile in the colon is important for healthy micro-flora balance and colon health.
 
Overall, it is critical to have proper digestion and absorption of food so that it does not end up in the colon and result in toxic by-products. These toxic products must be cleared by the liver. Reducing the amount of undigested food may assist with liver detoxification by reducing the build-up in the colon, especially proteins and fats.

<p>I love this product!

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was recently diagnosed with an enlarged liver&hellip; the doctors didn&rsquo;t really give me any advise on how to move forward and what I needed to do. I had been feeling really horrible and constantly getting sick. So after a lot of research I decided to give a cleanse a try. I ordered this product after a few reccomindations and checking out all the reviews. It got to me quick and in good shape.I have almost finished the bottle and I can tell you I have felt so much better. Way more energy, I haven&rsquo;t gotten sick and the pain in my abdomen has subsided. I&rsquo;m very excited with how well this has worked out! I will warn you you will pee a lot haha.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-trying">Worth Trying</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying n the process but I&rsquo;m still hoping this is working. I&rsquo;m doing this cleanse to take care of myself from inside. I didn&rsquo;t get any effects until a week later and then I spent about two days &ldquo;evacuating&rdquo;. Other than that not much more. About a week and half into the cleanse someone asked me if I had lost weight. I think I may have. I&rsquo;m hoping my psoriasis clears up Considerably after this. I&rsquo;m sure that something is getting cleansed. I can definitely say that it&rsquo;s worth investing the money to get something good done for your body. At times we forget what certain organs do for our necessary life functions. So something we should all think about especially if we&rsquo;re not perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-sure-if-it-is-working">Not sure if it is working</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought one bottle for my wife and another for myself to do together. Both of us have had more abdominal discomfort than before we started. I&rsquo;ve done other cleanses before and always feel better when I&rsquo;m on it and then after. We&rsquo;re about 10 days into the 21 days and so far I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
