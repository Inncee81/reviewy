<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-sound-fits-well-excellent-customer-service">Good sound. Fits well. Excellent customer service.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These head phones fit my 2 year old perfectly. He wore these on a 4 hour flight with no issues. This would be a 5 star review had it not been for the fact that the headset broke after owning for less than 3 months.*** Update 1/23/2016****I am changing my review to a 5. Wow! What great customer service. After I wrote this review, I received a call from LilGadgets letting me know that they were going to replace the headset (the product has a 1 year warranty) and that the headset shouldn&rsquo;t have broken so quickly. She explained that they are always actively looking for ways to improve their product so things like a break don&rsquo;t happen. They took the time to reach out to me via Amazon and by phone. I really wish all products had such good customer support!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-small">VERY SMALL!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great for very small, young children. I&rsquo;m giving it a lower review because the product description isn&rsquo;t clear about that. These didn&rsquo;t come close to fitting my seven year old. As you can see from the picture I&rsquo;m including, even my two year old has to adjust the band to fit her head. They are very, very small. They sound great and look comfortable though. The carry case is a cute touch, and the wire is cloth covered to help protect it.Update: I have had the BEST experience with Lil&rsquo; Gadgets customer service. They messaged me on their own when this review went live, refunded my son&rsquo;s pair of headphones immediately, and in general worked hard to express sympathy for my issue. I couldn&rsquo;t be more thrilled. It&rsquo;s so unusual to experience that level of customer service these days. Bravo! The company should continue to thrive with that level of customer care. They also said they&rsquo;ll work on possibly including the specific dimensions of the headphones on the product description.</p>

<h5 id="and-6-year-old-perfectly-and-they-are-of-great-quality-would-definitely-order-again">&hellip; and 6 year old perfectly and they are of great quality! Would definitely order again</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought 2 and they fit my 2 year old and 6 year old perfectly and they are of great quality! Would definitely order again!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broken-3-5mm-cord-and-missing-asterisks-in-100-satisfaction-guarantee">Broken 3.5mm cord and Missing Asterisks in 100% Satisfaction Guarantee</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Buyer beware&hellip;In less than 6 months of having these headphones they are no longer working. It seems the 3.5mm mini cord is shorting out. I have been now working with the company to try to get them to replace the cord. After all the description says: 100% Satisfaction Guarantee - LilGadgets strongly stands behind each headphone it designs and sells. Each Connect+ headphone is backed with a one-year warranty and 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.&ldquo;&hellip;.However, I am being told that since I bought from an unauthorized retailer they will not honor this. I am confused because I am unsure how to tell who is authorized and unauthorized as I bought this on Amazon&hellip;The most comical thing about this is that it is just the mini-mini cable that needs replaced but the company instead insulted me by saying they could replace it for $4. That doesn&rsquo;t seem like the best customer service move.Finally, whats funny about this whole thing to me is, this is actually the 3rd set of headphones we have bought from LilGadgets over the last three years. We like the headphones but this leaves a sour taste in my mouth. We won&rsquo;t be buying anymore or doing business with a company that won&rsquo;t stand behind their 100% (asterisks missing) guarantee.Update: After complaining about the 100% satisfaction guarantee to the CSR via email the co-founder of the company replied. She said sorry and that they should stand by the guarantee regardless of how it was purchased. She is sending me a new cord, plus one extra in case the other one breaks. I have uped my review from one star to two because of this. The company still needs to figure out what is going on with their cord issues.</p>

<h5 id="first-impression-was-the-packaging-and-presentation-is-beautiful-i-was-so-excited-and-so-was-our">first impression was the packaging and presentation is beautiful! I was so excited and so was our &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I opened the box, first impression was the packaging and presentation is beautiful! I was so excited and so was our little one. However, they did not pass the putting on headphones herself test. To err on the side of caution, my kid just may lack coordination, I also had her do the same test with another pair I ordered (def not as nice of materials) and she was able to put those on just fine. Again, assuming it just may be her I had my other little one preform the same task and she too had difficulty putting these on comfortably on her own. They just didn&rsquo;t sit on their heads right, kept slipping forward or back no matter how we adjusted them. And they need to be able to put them on themselves in school. My little one&rsquo;s are 4&amp;6 and I would say smallish heads(efficient brains ;)). In the end, although I wanted these to be the ones we kept, we went with another brand that both could put on comfortably with ease. I think we were all heartbroken these had to go back.</p>

<h5 id="good-quality">Good quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 3 yr old enjoys wearing his headphones while on his tablet. Will be using it on our vacation soon. Good quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-sound-quality-fit-is-very-small">Good sound quality - fit is very small!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sound quality is good, but the fit is not great. My 6 year old daughter has a small head and still has to max out the length to cover her ears.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="lasted-less-than-3-months">Lasted less than 3 months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lasted less than 3 months. Great while they worked but I should have looked for a better quality product or purchased an extended warranty for a few more dollars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="purchased-these-for-my-daughter-a-few-months-ago-and">Purchased these for my daughter a few months ago and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased these for my daughter a few months ago and now, with only very light use, one ear phone doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-were-great-when-they-still-worked">These were great when they still worked</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These were great when they still worked, but after less than a year we can only hear a show&rsquo;s background noise and no dialogue. So frustrating!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="headphones-are-nice-and-can-be-folded-up-for-easy-storage">Headphones are nice and can be folded up for easy storage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Still having issues with the wires even after receiving a new set. Headphones are nice and can be folded up for easy storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-for-2-year-old">Excellent for 2-year old</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My 2-year old loves these so much because they fit her head perfectly and sound great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-boys-love-this-my-youngest-cannot-control-the-tablet-but">My boys love this. my youngest cannot control the tablet but &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a cute Idea to be able to share headphones with one tablet. My boys love this. my youngest cannot control the tablet but loves to be involved while watching brother on it!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had gotten two of these (the other a purple pair) and the kids and I both loved them. It&rsquo;s only been about 4 months that they&rsquo;ve used them (no more than a couple times a week)&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-poor-quality-and-going-right-in-the-trash">These are poor quality and going right in the trash</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these headphones 6 weeks ago, and after normal use, they are already broken. You have to wiggle the cord to make them work, and then the sound is only intermittent.</p>
