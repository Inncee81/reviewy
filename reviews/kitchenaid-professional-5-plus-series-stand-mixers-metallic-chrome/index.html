Product Description
The Professional 5 Plus has a powerful 450-watt motor that delivers enough power to handle the heaviest mixtures, and mixes large batches easily. This special bowl lift model has brackets on the bowl that fit over support pins on the stand mixer, which is than lifted up by a handle on the right side of the mixer to lock the bowl in place while mixing (this design is made to handle heavy mixtures and large recipes). The 5-quart polished stainless steel bowl is dishwasher safe. Its ergonomically designed handle is contoured to fit the hand and makes lifting the bowl more comfortable. This mixer also features a unique mixing action: the beater spins clockwise as the shaft spins counter clockwise, moving the beater to 67 different points around the bowl. This distinctive mixing action creates a thorough blend of ingredients and eliminates the need to rotate the bowl. 10 speeds allow the user to select the right speed for the mixing job, from very high to a very slow stir. The flat beater, dough hook, and professional wire whip add to the versatility of the mixer. In addition, the Soft Start mixing feature helps prevent ingredient splash-out and &ldquo;flour puff&rdquo; at startup, while &ldquo;Overload Reset&rdquo; helps eliminate overheating of the motor. A hinged hub cover flips up, allowing easy installation of attachments and never leaves the mixer. Optional attachments (sold separately) complete the package to make cooking a pleasure. From citrus juicer to sausage stuffer, KitchenAid stand mixers can handle just about any job in the kitchen.</p>

Thirty percent more powerful than KitchenAid’s previous 5-quart stand mixers, this professional model efficiently tackles heavy loads with its 450-watt motor, direct-drive all-steel gear transmission, and bowl-lift lever that effortlessly raises heavy ingredients up to the beater. KitchenAid stand mixers, constructed of durable die-cast metal, come in a variety of colors and styles that have become American classics.</p>

<p>With a choice of ten speeds and three attachments&ndash;flat beater, spiral dough hook, and stainless-steel wire whip&ndash;the mixer handles everything from egg whites to meat loaf to pizza dough. Rather than rotating the bowl, KitchenAid stand mixers feature a fixed bowl with a unique mixing action: the beater spins clockwise as the shaft spins counter-clockwise, thus projecting the beater to 67 different points inside the 5-quart stainless-steel bowl. In deference to its power, the Soft-Start feature prevents splashing and flour clouds by gearing up to each speed gradually; then the electronic speed sensor kicks in to maintain a constant speed even when mixing the thickest batter. The bowl features a handle as well as two pins that hook into the lifting mechanism, which consists of a solid metal arm the same color as the mixer and a stainless-steel lever. A hinged attachment hub makes changing attachments easy. For safety, the mixer shuts down if an object obstructs the mixing process or if overloading occurs. The bowl, beater, and dough hook are dishwasher-safe. Assembled in Ohio, the mixer measures 16-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> by 12 by 14 inches and is backed by a hassle-free, one-year warranty. &ndash;Ann Bieri</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve only had this a few days, but I do have some observations.I originally had a KitchenAid pro 500 series with a 325 watt &ldquo;heavy duty&rdquo; motor with metal gears and a solid transmission design which I purchased over 20 years ago from Williams-Sonoma in &ldquo;Williams-Sonoma Green.&rdquo; I moved, changed to an all black and white kitchen and with hardly any counter space, it was relegated to a hall closet. At 30lbs it was unwieldy at best, so the little baking I did became even littler. I finally sold it.However, I do like to cook and I felt vulnerable w/o a mixer. I figured my Cuisinart food processor would fill the gap, but it didn&rsquo;t quite hit that same sweet spot, and a hand mixer, well, it was just so &ndash; hand mixer.When KitchenAid announced it was coming out with the Artisan-mini it sounded like the perfect solution&ndash;a stand mixer that conserved counter-space. I figured I would wait until some reviews were in and now that they are, I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t buy it. It sounds like it&rsquo;s a dog of a machine and at $335 (now it&rsquo;s a bit lower), it seemed comparatively expensive. Also, it&rsquo;s only 250 watts, which is just 25 watts above KitchenAid&rsquo;s hand mixer. It all came down to a big &ldquo;why bother?&ldquo;I turned elsewhere. The tilt head machines (Artisan, Classic Plus, Artisan Design) seemed to be plagued by mechanical issues arising from a combination of price-saving plastic and metal parts. Buyers complained about a clanking noise, a grinding sound and metal shavings flaking into food. There were problems with the hinge mechanism&ndash; over time the head would loosen, rock from side to side or break altogether. Models with coated attachments had problems with surface peeling with the result that plastic coating, sometimes in combination with metal shavings and grease, fell into the food.I wanted this as a mainstay in my kitchen, something that would provide years of use, not built-in obsolescence. My philosophy is to buy the right thing once, even if I have to pay more. I was becoming sorry I sold my old model, despite the fact it was green.I then discovered this model which has been discontinued by KitchenAid. It doesn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s &ldquo;solid state&rdquo; but comments indicate it&rsquo;s all metal parts, and I confirmed with the company it has the Direct-Drive Transmission and All-Metal Construction. It doesn&rsquo;t have the tilt-head mechanism, but instead the more reliable bowl lift design which is a characteristic of the larger models, which is what my old one had. Yes, it&rsquo;s big and heavy, but 5 quarts is still smaller than 6 or 7 and it&rsquo;s powerful, not the puny 250 watts of the Artisan-mini or KitchenAid Classic. According to reviewers this was made in 425 and 525 watt versions. I&rsquo;m pleased that Amazon intuited my preference and sent me the more powerful 525 watt version.As far as differences are concerned, the paddle, dough hook and bowl seem lighter and thinner than than the ones that came with my old KitchenAid. Items such as bowl cover, pouring guard and quilted cover that were included with my KitchenAid are now sold as &ldquo;extras,&rdquo; but at least they&rsquo;re available.As far as power is concerned, it comfortably handled cookie dough, but that&rsquo;s not much of a test so we&rsquo;ll see. Are the attachments tough enough? we&rsquo;ll see. on that too. I&rsquo;ll update this as necessary.I did not put the bowl or paddle in the dishwasher. I noticed that a greasy residue remained on the bowl and paddle even after cleaning. I washed it again and again then tried 409 but they still don&rsquo;t feel clean. The bowl also seems to have become stained &ndash; by cookie dough? For an all stainless bowl, I think this is weird.Yes, it&rsquo;s big and heavy but I&rsquo;ve made room for this so it can remain on the counter. In terms of price, I got a lot more for less. This was at least $100 less than the Artisan-mini, it&rsquo;s compatible with all KitchenAid&rsquo;s many accessories whereas the Artisan-mini isn&rsquo;t, and I won&rsquo;t need to think twice about what I use it for&ndash;it&rsquo;s large enough to handle all my needs and at 525 watts it&rsquo;s a much more powerful and hopefully better made machine than the tilt-head versions.All in all, this seems to be one of the most reliable models available&ndash;now if I could only clean that bowl to my satisfaction &hellip; !!!</p>

<h5 id="wanted-one-for-a-lifetime">Wanted one for a lifetime!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely LOVE this mixer! It is big enough for all of my needs and still fits on my counter with a white quilted cover purchased to protect it. I never have to scrape the bowl anymore because of the dynamics of the mixer. Have made bread in it and OMG how easy it is!! The dough hook takes care of the mixing and kneading! I have never had a mixer with a non-tilting head, which I quickly learned to use. Always wanted a KitchenAid but never could afford one. Now the prices are reasonable and if you look around, they are always on sale somewhere. I got mine on Amazon Prime for an excellent discount and free shipping! This product is one I would highly recommend and this particular size (rather than the larger &ldquo;6&rdquo; size) is perfect for the home kitchen.</p>

<h5 id="bowl-attachment-could-be-improved">Bowl attachment could be improved</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have always loved the design and technical capabilities of the Kitchen Aid mixers and I have owned a couple. I upgraded to this larger size and have used it about 6 months.This was my first with the bowl lift and while I like the function (more room to pour and scrape without making a mess), getting the bowl back into the tabs takes some practice and a few more seconds than the twist out base the regular versions have. If you are unsure about how this works, there are videos on YouTube. Also, if you want to hold the bowl or use it outside of the mixer, you have the metal tabs sticking out so you have to be mindful of that.The only other complaint I have is the bowl-lift handle; most models come with a knob that covers it and this one doesn&rsquo;t have it. It looks a little weird and is not ergonomic if you will be using it a lot. I&rsquo;m making a wooden one to attach to fix the problem, but it&rsquo;s a small disappointment. I didn&rsquo;t buy it for the handle, LoL.The power is there, the attachments are great, the mixing design is stellar. Works as expected.</p>

<h5 id="this-mixer-is-great-it-is-very-strong">This mixer is great. It is very strong</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mixer is great. It is very strong. It will power through the thickest dough we put in it. The soft start feature is one of the best things about it. After 3 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> years of use this thing is as good as it was when it was new. The paint has not dulled and all parts are still in place. I know people that have 25+ years into a KitchenAid and they are still going. This model still has the metal gears and better bearings. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with one of these.</p>
