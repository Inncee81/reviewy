<h5 id="great-card-that-works-like-it-is-suppose-to">Great card that works like it is suppose to.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m upgrading cards in my older digital camera&rsquo;s getting ready for a trip back east this summer. The 2 GB Kingston card in one camera served me well, but on my replacement hit list. My friends have older deer cams that can only take 2 GB non-SDHC cards, so they are going to be benefiting from my upgrades also.For the price, I took the plunge. Remembering years ago how expensive Flash Memory was, I laughed when I hit the checkout button on Amazon paying for this card.Received this card today.* Blister pack packaging* NO card case or holder included* Class 10 rating* 10 year warranty &ndash; no longer lifetime for any sales after <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>14</sub>* If you want longer warranty, go with the Extreme series &ndash; 30 years.* I like this &ndash; Waterproof, Shock proof and X-Ray proof on the packaging* Card was &ldquo;Made in China&rdquo;, not Korea &ndash; all good things come to an end* Formatted FAT-32 out of the box* Reported 14.8 GB right out of the package - the bit/byte thing in play* Reformatted for my camera when I put it in to avoid any incompatibilitiesLike prior SanDisk products, they just work. My test pics show the card working just as it should.I cannot give this card my full 5 star rating since SanDisk changed their &ldquo;Lifetime&rdquo; warranty to a 10 year warranty back in February of 2014 and this card was made in China, not Korea as they have been in the past. Had the original lifetime SanDisk warranty remained and not gone to being China made, I would have given this SDHC card my full 5 star rating.Unlike yesteryear, upgrade to larger memory for the dirt cheap prices on flash memory today. You will not be sorry.</p>

<h5 id="a-good-and-reliable-memory-card">A good and reliable memory card&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have 4 of these for my pro Canon video camcorder and use it for my business. The cards have been very reliable. A few times, I could not erase the card - the computer would tell me that it was write protected and could not be erased. The lock on the card was not engaged. I engaged it and tried again, getting the now expected &lsquo;write protected&rsquo; message. Then I turn the lock off again and put it back in the slot - this time, I could scrub the card and have it empty and ready to go for more video shooting. This has only happened a few times out of many uses (2 of the 4 cards maybe?), and I do not know why it happens at all. After the maneuver I described in this post, I am able to proceed as planned and clear the card for the next use. I don&rsquo;t know if this happens randomly with other cards or not. Overall, I would still recommend this card for the reliability I have experienced so far.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-windows-xp-note">Works Great - Windows XP Note&hellip;..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works perfectly. Have not had any glitches in months of use. Very happy.(Side Note: Be Aware that if you are using Windows XP it cannot normally access a disk size larger than 32 GB. It is not set up for that. I purchased aSanDisk 64 GB before this one and even with many patches I tried it failed to work on Windows XP. So stick with 32GB max size like this or smaller and you&rsquo;ll be happy.) This is the 3rd SanDisk I have purchased an have never had any problems with them.One last note. The little 10 with the circle means that it can transfer the data faster than the ones with a 4 and a circle. This is important when using a medium to high end digital camera with large image file sizes. So you don&rsquo;t have to wait so long for the camera to be ready for the next photo. This one is perfect and runs great with my mid priced Sony Camera.</p>

<h5 id="great-card">Great card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My old SD card for my 3DS was slow and it failed one day. I got this as a replacement t for it, and was amazed at how much difference having a class 10 card made. This thing is lightning fast and I don&rsquo;t have to worry about running out of space for games and saves.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-specific-uses-only">Good for specific uses only</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me start by saying that this product does work exactly as it is supposed to. It is durable holds a significant amount of photos or video. The reason I give if only three stars is that for the price you can buy faster or larger cards. In fact I purchased a few 32gb Samsung mirco SD cards that were twice this fast for about $15 at Best Buy shortly before buying this card. Knowing that, I had to purchase this card because my wife&rsquo;s Cannon T2i performs at its best with this type and speed of SD card. We tried my Samsung Micro SD card in her Cannon and it didn&rsquo;t work nearly as fast as this card. But in my Gopro 4 the Samsung card was a speed demon in which case a slower card like this just won&rsquo;t cut it(plus is not micro). After doing some research I found out that her Canon T2i doesn&rsquo;t support cards that are faster than this class of SD card.</p>

<h5 id="sandisk-ultra-32gb-class-10-memory-card">SanDisk Ultra 32GB Class 10 Memory Card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have been using a smaller 8 GB card for one of our security cameras but I wanted something faster and with more room for our outdoor trail cam since it will be recording videos most of the time, as well as high quality still pictures. This card uploads to my laptop very quickly, in fact I liked it so much a week later I bought another one. Now I just swap out a fresh card for the filled card when necessary so the camera is always ready. I haven&rsquo;t had any issues with these SD cards. The HD videos and still pictures I&rsquo;ve uploaded from these cards are great, even when the camera is in night mode. I would recommend these SD cards 100% and would buy this brand again when I need more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-loved-this-when-i-first-got-it-but-after-only">I loved this when I first got it but after only &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I loved this when I first got it but after only a short time, I went to put it back in the camera and it broke. It took us over an hour to get the rest of the card out of the camera, I hope it didn&rsquo;t hurt it. I am assuming this is only a fluke in that card and have ordered to replace it. I was however a little peeved to find out that it wasn&rsquo;t covered for replacement after such a short time.</p>

<h5 id="sandisk-great-sd-cards">SanDisk = great SD cards!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d bought a set of 2 of these 8GB cards as an Amazon &ldquo;add on&rdquo; at an excellent price.I&rsquo;ve had SanDisk cards since my first 1GB, yes that is a ONE Gig card that cost $50.00 marked down from $100.00!!! And I am also very happy that storage has gotten so much cheaper. I still have that 1GB card too, I use it for a photo frame but it still works!I&rsquo;ve only had one SanDisk card failure but it was a 64GB Micro SD card and I feel that my phone at the time corrupted that card.The SanDisk 8&rsquo;s 16&rsquo;s and 32&rsquo;s I use for my cameras all work fine and I&rsquo;ve never had a failure or lost photos with any of those&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;yet.</p>
