<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>Length:25 Feet (Single Pack)  |  Style:HDMI Male to Male
Overview:</p>

<p>The HDMI cable is the newest and best digital video connection on the market. HDMI is the only cable that can transfer uncompressed high-definition video and multi channel digital audio in resolutions higher than 1080p. HDMI cables are convenient because they will allow the transfer of digital audio and video in a single cable, permitting a less confusing mess of wires and a cleaner entertainment center. They are backward compatible to all previous versions.</p>

<p>Main Features:</p>

<p>• 1080p Resolution. Audio Return Channel 3D - 3D is the latest rage for both home theater and gaming.</p>

<p>• 4K - The 4K resolution is 3840 x 2160 pixels @ 24 Hz.</p>

<p>• Deep Color - The Deep Color feature provides a minimum of 8-bits per color element (24-bits total), providing for a total of over 16 million color variations. x.v.Color - x.v.Color High Definition Audio - HDMI supports a full range of high definition audio types, including SA-CD, DVD-Audio, DTS-HD Master Audio, and Dolby TrueHD.</p>

<p>Specifications:</p>

<p>• Our High Speed HDMI cables - with Ethernet have been designed to meet the performance standards. They are backward compatible to all previous versions.</p>

<p>• HDMI Ethernet Channel - The HDMI cable adds a data channel to the HDMI connection, enabling high-speed, bi-directional communication. Connected devices that include this feature can send and receive data via 100 Mb/sec Ethernet, making them instantly ready for any IP-based application.</p>

<p>• Audio Return Channel - The new specification adds an audio channel that will reduce the number of cables required to deliver audio &ldquo;&ldquo;upstream&rdquo;&rdquo; from a TV to an A/V receiver for processing and playback. In cases where a TV features an internal content source, such as a built-in tuner or DVD player, the Audio Return Channel allows the TV to send audio data upstream to the A/V receiver via the HDMI cable, eliminating the need for an extra cable.</p>

<p>• 3D Support - The version of the specification defines common 3D formats and resolutions for HDMI-enabled devices, enabling 3D gaming and other 3D video applications.</p>

<p>• 4K Resolution Support - The new specification enables HDMI devices to support extremely high HD resolutions, effectively four times the resolution of a 1080p device. Support for 4K allows the HDMI interface to transmit digital content at the same resolution as the state-of-the-art Digital Cinema systems used in many movie theaters.</p>

<h5 id="great-hdmi-cables-and-you-can-t-beat-the-price">Great HDMI cables and you can&rsquo;t beat the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a bit skeptical buying an HDMI cable for so cheap. I needed one to plug in my PS3 so I figured since this was so cheap I might as well give it a shot. So after taking it out of the package I plugged it in and saw very clear sound and picture transfer over to the TV. In order to see if there was any difference, I plugged in my $50 Monster HDMI cable and in my eyes I could not tell one difference between the two. The only difference was the money that was flying out of my pocket when it came to purchasing the Monster HDMI cable. Honestly, I can&rsquo;t justify paying more than 10 bucks anymore for HDMI cables because what I found here was a perfectly compatible cable that did it&rsquo;s job just as well as way more expensive HDMI cables. On top of this, some reviewers said that there is some interference when it is near other cords. My HDMI is surrounded by at least 5 other cords and it does not pick up any interference.If you need an HDMI cord, you should look into these. After all what&rsquo;s the worse than can happen? You get a defective unit and you&rsquo;re out 2 bucks and some change. I need to buy an HDMI cord soon to plug in my new HD receiver to my new TV and I will not hesitate twice to buy these again! If you have any questions, feel free to ask me and I would be more than happy to answer them.</p>

<h5 id="i-have-this-connected-from-a-computer-to-a-4k">I have this connected from a computer to a 4K &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have this connected from a computer to a 4K tv that is approximately 60ft away. I had a few other cables that I bought but I still had the problem of flickering or loss of signal. With the cable, the tv doesn&rsquo;t flicker at all and there is no loss of signal. I also have a splitter connected to it and that goes to a second tv that is even further away and there has been no flickering or loss on signal on that one too.If you are going to use a splitter, make sure that the cables are cascaded with one feeding the other through only one splitter.</p>

<h5 id="beware-avoid-this-cable-it-s-a-waste">BEWARE!!!!! Avoid this cable. It&rsquo;s a waste</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>BEWARE!!!!! This cable is bad and failed within the first 2 weeks of buying. Unfortunately, I cannot return it now as the date to return has passed.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-30-hdmi-cabel-for-long-distances">Excellent 30&rsquo; HDMI CABEL for long distances.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>30feet from my living room tv &amp; my downstairs powder room. With a HDMI splitter box and tv in my bathroom, I can run when needed, not pause the tv, and have continuous watching when needed. The 30&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t require any power jumper to go that long a distance, as I had been warned might be necessary.</p>

<h5 id="high-quality-item-outstanding-deal">High Quality item, Outstanding deal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a PS3 for a while now, but I never really use it to play games. My reason for that was that it made this constant, loud, buzzing sound that annoyed me to the point of violence if I even thought about spending more than two hours on it. So I don&rsquo;t, I only used it for blu rays as I can take the sound long enough for a movie to play. After a while it seemed clear that the standard AV cable for the PS3 was damaged, and that I should probably get a new one. But I pushed it off, as I own an obsurd amount of DVDs, but a small amount of blu rays, meaning I don&rsquo;t really need to use it often.After a while, I found myself with three dollars left on an amazon gift card. Hating to waste a gift, I started looking for something I might need. It occurred to me to look for an HDMI cable for the PlayStation to cease the buzzing, so I did just that. After some searching, I came across this one for $2.18, free shipping as well. I found this to be an insane deal, so I bought it as I wouldn&rsquo;t really be spending any money on it.When it came, I didn&rsquo;t think it would be that good. I thought it would look like what an AV cable would look like, I was just hoping the buzzing would finally stopped. I plugged it in, and not only did the buzzing stopp, it finally occurred to me how horrible the video was before then. I was blown away by how crisp the picture was, and as quickly as I could I got one of the blu rays I hadn&rsquo;t seen due to the runtime being well over two hours, which was way to long to endure that awful sound. The blu ray looked outstanding, like a blu ray should look.If you need an HDMI cable, don&rsquo;t hesitate to get this one just because you think it&rsquo;s cheapness is due to poor quality. I can&rsquo;t tell the difference between this one and the one given to us for our cable box when we got our LCD TV. It&rsquo;s too good a deal to turn down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this 25 footer that I use to connect to my 40&rdquo; flat-screen TV. I was so surprised that I have no noticeable signal strength in audio or video. I do not need my Roku wireless Wi-Fi box for most of my my streaming channels.</p>

<h5 id="100-hdmi-needs-vga-adapter-help">100&rsquo; HDMI needs VGA adapter help</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good quality cable. But, don&rsquo;t expect any cable over 50&rsquo; to carry your HDMI signal. HDMI loses most capability and 1080p quality over 50&rsquo;. I solved this by using a $15 female HDMI to male VGA connector at the monitor 100&rsquo; away from the source. This works great and even though it reduces to 720p using VGA, it&rsquo;s better than no signal at all for my security camera purposes. Read about HDMI signal loss online and you&rsquo;ll agree with my solution.</p>

<h5 id="argh-never-mind-it-works-great">Argh!&hellip;NEVER MIND it works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>NEVER MIND! Whoops had no idea that it was directional. One side says screen and the other side says source. I had them flipped. I went back down after discovering this, and bam it works just as the description states!&mdash;&ndash;Someone, anyone make this right! Furious. Ran the cable underneath the house. Just about broke my back and it doesn&rsquo;t work. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t test. Will raise review if someone makes this right! So mad and disappointed.</p>
