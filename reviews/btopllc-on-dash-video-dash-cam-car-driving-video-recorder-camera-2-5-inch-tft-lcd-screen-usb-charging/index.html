<h5 id="i-ve-purchased-a-few-in-the-past-but-honestly-this-little-one-is-way-better-than-anyone-i-ve-purchased">Iâ€™ve purchased a few in the past but honestly this little one is way better than anyone Iâ€™ve purchased!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it for a few days now and so far it has exceeded my expectations. It has a wide view, it does well in the heat so far (although I do still take it down out of the sun when I&rsquo;m not using it), the suction cup on it hasn&rsquo;t broken which I seem to have bad luck with usually, the video itself is fantastic quality, and the size of the dash cam is exactly what Iâ€™ve been looking for. Extremely easy installation, great instruction, and does everything I want it to do! Great purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-versatile">Very Versatile.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Â I like the design and ease of use, very stable on my car, and the video quality is great. I also like how it folds out when I want to see more of whats going on. Very easy to setup and retrieve the files, and works great at night as well. feels very durable, and comes with everything I need to get started. I use this for any issues involving traffic, there fore you can have some kind of proof going into court.The suction is very strong, and have not unlatched yet, and its been a couple of days. It allows for different angles for me to start recording the front, side, or back of the vehicle, very handy when being pulled over, or car accidents etc.I recommend this for the protection of yourself and others, especially when it comes to getting tickets and such.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-install">Easy install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Â This was very nice for the price. I love recording while I&rsquo;m driving. I live up in the mountains so you never know what you will find out there. It&rsquo;s super user friendly. My dad is 62 and he is the one who set it up. It does require an sd card. To record. Not included.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-dash-cam">Great dash cam!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great dash cam. The camera includes a power adapter to plug into your car as well as a data cable so you can download videos to your computer. The camera also has a removable rechargeable battery. The video saves onto a SD car that is not included. The quality of the video is great and can really help provide information to the police if you are involved in an accident.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-dash-cam-1">Great dash cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really nice dash camera it&rsquo;s well made material is great just as shown on picture really nice and clear picture comes with instructions it&rsquo;s easy to set up has different settings on recording and has its chargers likes it a lot really recommend it. Specially if you live in a city or travel a lot helps alot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for">You get what you pay for</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered the small profile dash cam with the flip down screen. Given the positive reviews I wanted to give this a try. I should have realized &ldquo;you get what you pay for&rdquo;.The windshield mounting system is flimsy and does not tighten down well. The camera will shift in place when trying to open the screen or press menu buttons. The menu interface is hard to navigate and is not intuitive. The directions are lacking when it comes to fully explaining the menu and it&rsquo;s functions. As far as I can tell there&rsquo;s no way for the camera to overwrite old videos, so the SD card needed to manually deleted when full.There is no good indicator the camera is recording if the screen is folded up.The video quality is poor. Must be really close to another car to begin to read the license plate.After 3 days the camera stopped reading my SD card but the SD card would open on a computer so I know the SD card is still good. I do not trust this device to be consistent, be able to get a clear picture of a license plate, or stay mounted in place.It&rsquo;s garbage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="almost-5-stars">Almost 5 stars.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would had given it 5 stars, but when the LCD screen is folded up, its doesn&rsquo;t turn off, making the LCD to burn out that much faster. I bought 2 units &amp; both does it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="affordable-high-quality-dash-cam">Affordable, high quality dash cam</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with the quality and performance of this dash cam. It&rsquo;s quite affordable too. Installing and set up was easy, took about 15 minutes to complete and the instructions are clear. I like the large viewing screen, and that the device automatically records when I start my car. The camera also rotates fully so I can catch those priceless toddler dance sessions in the back seat, at a moment&rsquo;s notice. The picture and sound quality is great, although it isn&rsquo;t exactly HD like a television would have. Still very crisp and clear. The internal stabilizer works great too. The camera does not come with the SD card but those are easily obtainable. Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and would recommend it to anyone interested.</p>
