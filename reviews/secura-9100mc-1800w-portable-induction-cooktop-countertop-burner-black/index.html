<h5 id="great-product-i-recommend">Great Product, I Recommend.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like it and I have now purchased 3 of these. They are quite economical and take up little space yet can do a large job (see pictures including a large 12 inch sauce pan). Easy to operate and extremely fast, so far they doo all that the manufacturer said they will do. I am quite pleased. I can store when not needed and even take out side in good weather and use in conjunction with my BBQ.I have had to get used to cooking so quickly, this is not like an electric hot plate, this is real induction cooking. You can cook 2 ways one by setting and monitoring the temperature or, two by setting an a specified level that will not be temperature sensative, great for searing. There are built in safety provisions such as auto shut down after 70 minutesYou must have proper cookware, check your pans with a magnet. If the magnet sticks they should be ok, if the magnet does not stick you will need new pans. My Wolfgang Puck pans were copper-clad and did not work so I purchased some great Duxtop cookware (pictured beneath the cook tops)..</p>

<h5 id="uneven-heating">Uneven heating</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tried to cook some bacon on this and I was surprised at how unevenly it heated. I tried two different pans (a cast iron pan and an All Clad pan). There was a significant hot spot near the center. Later I did some tests using the All Clad, which was about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; larger in diameter than the outer circle on the cooktop. I sprinkled some flour in the pan and turned on the cooktop to see where it started to brown first. There was very clearly a hot spot near the center of the cooktop. Just to be sure it wasn&rsquo;t due to variations in the metal of the pan I ran the test again, but this time I offset the pan. There was still a hot spot, and it was near the center of the cooktop (not the center of the pan). I also took the temperature at the center and edge of the pan with an infrared thermometer and there was a 90F difference. See the photos.If I was was just using this to heat up water or keep some other liquid warm, I think it it would be fine. For anything else, I&rsquo;m not so sure. It took a fair bit of shuffling to cook bacon without burning the center while leaving the ends raw.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This little induction cooktop does everything it needs to do very well on a countertop. If you want to cook your food without heating the entire room then this is the counter \ table top cooking unit for you. Remember that this is an induction cooktop which means it heats the pan by exciting the atoms in magnetic pans. If a pan does not have a strong attraction for a magnet you can not use the cookware on any induction cooktop.I found it best to use a stainless steel or cast iron pan that has a very flat bottom. If your magnetic pan has too many curves, patterns, dents, bends or decorations in its bottom the cooktop metal sensors might not auto detect the pan when it is in place on the cooktop. Cooking with magnitism is like cooking with gas in that any change in the settings is almost immediately translated to change in heat levels the pan and food. the minute you change the heat the inducer immediately stops aggitating the atoms and the heat drops off fairly quickly. In an heating element stove waste heat continues to discharge long after the element has been reduced or turned off.Cooking the perfect dish is all about being able to manage the heat input into the pan and the food contained therein. Magnetic induction cooking allows for the most percise cooking due to its ability to terminate heat and moderate heat in an almost instanteanous way. Best of all Induction cooking does not polute the room with lots of waste heat as radiiant elements do. Radiant elements raise your air conditioning bills in summer because; they heat the house along with the food. Induction cooking heats only the pan, the room is heated only by the waste heat from the cooking process itself. Another cool thing about induction cooking is it allows you to bring the cooking to the table if you want to show off your cooking skills. If you want to make pancakes right at the table this will let you do just that. I have a flat cast iron pancake griddle and I can make pancakes right at the table with this WOW how awesome.The settings and controls on this DUXTOP unit are clear and easy to understand. Another cool thing is the numbers light up they are NOT LCD numbers that are often harder to read when you get older. This unit is better for old people because; unlike radiant heat burners these magnetic stoves don&rsquo;t get as hot. Yes the pan is hot but their is not the danger posed by waste radiant heat. Another safety system is the DUXTOP magnetic cook top turns itself off when the magnetic pot, griddle or pan is removed from its surface. No more fires from leaving a radiant cooking source in the on position. If an elderly person takes the cooking vessel off the magnetic cooktop all energy shuts down and the surface becomes cool to the ytouch much sooner than any radiant heat cooking source. This Magnetic induction cooking technology is awesome for so many reasons and I just shared a few here.This DUXTOP unit is awesome. I have had no trouble with it heating up and doing everything I need. The only negative is the heat only goes to 450F and I would have liked 500F. I like making candy apples for the kids. I need a really hot pan to make candy apples. It is a small inconvenience but I note it in fairness and accuracy. I am still happy I purchased the DUXTOP 1800 watt Induction Cooktop.</p>
