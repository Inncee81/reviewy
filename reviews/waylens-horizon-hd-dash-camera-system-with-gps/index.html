<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following the Waylens dashcam since it was on Kickstarter. I&rsquo;m a driving enthusiast, so a camera like this that allowed driving metrics like speed, RPMs, and boost to be displayed was a huge interest. I&rsquo;ve been living with the camera for almost a week now, and I&rsquo;ve come to love it.Like other have said, the mount for the camera is finicky at best. The mount &ldquo;grabs&rdquo; the camera from the front and the back, and if it only has one side clipped, the camera is likely to fly off going through corners. Double checking after reinstalling the camera is a necessity. I haven&rsquo;t seen or experienced any issues with the suction cup, but I&rsquo;ve thought about alternatives like double-sided velcro like materials instead.The Android app leaves a little to be desired. The camera itself broadcasts a Wi-Fi signal which your phone, and the app, connects to. If you&rsquo;re within range of your home network, this may cause confusion on the phone/app&rsquo;s part. Equally confusing is when you&rsquo;re on the road and connected to the camera&rsquo;s Wi-Fi as well as your cell network&rsquo;s signal. If you want to access the camera while connected to your cell network, you may have to turn off the cell network to do so, etc. Kind of complicated.The desktop app works as expected for the most part. It takes some getting used to, but I would recommend importing your clips from the camera before doing any cutting or highlighting. Otherwise you&rsquo;re editing clips on the camera over USB, which is noticeably slower. Combining multiple clips isn&rsquo;t possible as far as I can tell. I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s easier to just edit on a PC than from a smartphone.As for the camera itself - it&rsquo;s impressive. Day and night footage is what you&rsquo;d expect to get from a GoPro, crisp and fluid at 1080p max. You can lower the resolution and framerate (from 60 to 30) if storage space is of concern. I have a 128GB card from SanDisk in mine, and it estimates over 10 hours of recording time at the max 1080p/60fps. Like another user mentioned, it does take a minute or two after starting for the remote and OBDII dongle to connect, but the camera displays a notification when they do connect. You can swipe through a live view or different metrics for the camera itself to display - from speed and RPM to pitch/roll, G-force, and boost/vacuum. I found my camera will automatically start when I start the car, but I haven&rsquo;t tested its auto-shutoff. I manually stop the recording and turn off the camera when leaving the vehicle.Also worth noting, in the promotional videos and some early footage people have released, there is a data overlay for ambient temperature, pressure, and weather conditions. Those currently are not showing up for me on any of my clips. Could be a bug, but I haven&rsquo;t contacted Waylens to inquire about it. And lastly, in response to the claim that speed is calculated by your GPS coordinates - I haven&rsquo;t seen any evidence to this fact. I know for a fact that I had no GPS signal at one point, but my speed was still accurate the entire time. This makes sense since speed is a parameter provided over OBDII.EDIT 02/13/2017 - Seems that at some point the data overlay for ambient temperature and weather conditions is working again. Not sure if there was an update or an issue on my end that was causing it not to show up, but it works now! Everything else still stands, I&rsquo;m loving the camera.</p>

<h5 id="40-of-a-product">40% of a product&hellip;..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea of combining a camera system with an ODB dongle to allow for seamless creation of in-car video with overlay is brilliant. The execution of the Waylens Horizion is disappointing &ndash; especially at this price point. I wanted so much to like this camera, but ultimately I have returned it to Amazon. Here are the problems as I see them.1. The mount &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t have the issues many on the forums have reported with it falling down constantly, however I think it needs to be more secure for any track sessions. Ideally there should be a hook for some sort of tether as well. It seemed okay for street driving.2. Overheating &ndash; it will overheat in a car on a hot day. I ended up pointing an air vent up at the camera.3. ODB &ndash; the parameters you can log are highly limited. (rpm/speed/throttle/maf/boost). Waylens claims to be working on an update to allow selection of alternate PID&rsquo;s &ndash; however they indicate that there is a hardware limit to how many PIDs can be logged at a time. The cataloging capability WITH video is the highlight of this system and it is essentially neutered by the hardware &ndash; that is unacceptable at this price point.4. Bluetooth ODB and Button &ndash; neither of these connect with great reliability. The button almost always requires an initial press before it will connect.5. Software &ndash; the Mac software is awful. It crashes at the end of nearly every import. The process for selecting highlights is awkward and clunky - it is not precise.6. Overlay options &ndash; the overlay options are all very limited and pretty ugly.7. Lap Timer &ndash; the lap timer option is downright dangerous. Every time you start the camera you have to press the display TWO times at the point on track where you want the new lap to start. It&rsquo;s entirely unsafe to do this on a race track. The camera should allow you to store a lap start preset and load it from memory. Then you would be able to walk to the start/finish line with the camera on battery and store the pre-set in advance of any track session.The idea behind the product is really good, but it&rsquo;s only 40% of what it should be. Waylens seems to be putting some effort into to adding and fixing features but they really shouldn&rsquo;t have shipped with this degree of incompletion&hellip;</p>

<p>Afther a few months of using it - I was expecting something way much better, don&rsquo;t get me wrong it is a really nice dash cam, however for the $$$ is not worth it (at least yet). The app sucks, the interface is not the best and there are too many flaws&hellip; without mention the windshield mount is a joke!
