<h5 id="sounds-great-bluetooth-is-awesome">Sounds great! Bluetooth is awesome!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this soundbar! It works really well and was easy to set up. I LOVE how easy it is to connect our smart phone or iPad to for playing music and having dance parties with our 3 year old. :)The sound quality is exceptional for a soundbar. Good bass and not very tinny when it gets really loud. We used the digital cable to connect it to our TV.I wish it would switch back and forth between the Bluetooth and TV input with one button, but instead you have to click the input button a few times until you get the right one again&hellip; not a deal breaker but something that I&rsquo;ve noticed. I used it with and 55 inch LG TV and would recommend it to my friends and family.I will update it there are any changes to my opinion or if the product doesn&rsquo;t hold up to normal wear and tear. Thanks for reading.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bluetooth-didn-t-pair-on-the-one-i-received">Bluetooth didn&rsquo;t pair on the one I received</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My refurbished sound bar came with all the proper accessories and hooked up to my TV easily - Vizio offered several cable options. The sound is OK - not great; but not bad for the price paid. Mine just refused to pair with my almost-new Smartphone that I have successfully paired with 4 cars and a few other Bluetooth speakers (in other words, the problem isn&rsquo;t the phone). And yes, I carefully read and heeded the directions to no avail.This might be a nice addition to a bedroom TV, for example; but as the main TV speaker that I had <em>hoped</em> would also play my music via Bluetooth - well, thank goodness for Amazon because I&rsquo;m returning it and not ordering another.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-obviously-not-great-this-soundbar-was-exactly-what-we-needed">but obviously not great. This soundbar was exactly what we needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&rsquo;t beat this soundbar for the price. I put this in my bedroom with a 48 inch vizio flat screen. The built-in speakers on the television were okay, but obviously not great. This soundbar was exactly what we needed. For me, there was no reason to put a $400+ top of the line sound bar in our bedroom, which is a smaller room where we don&rsquo;t watch television nearly as much (or at a high volume). This speaker made watching movies in bed more enjoyable, and helps us hear dialogue more easily when the tv volume is turned down lower at night (i.e. if me or my wife is trying to sleep). Clearer, fuller sound at just a low price - totally worth it. I have a sonos soundbar with sub in my main TV room, and it never crosses my mind that i am dealing with a less expensive or less capable sound bar in the bedroom simply because it functions perfectly for its purpose there.</p>

<h5 id="false-advertisement-did-not-come-with-remote-or-power">False advertisement. Did not come with remote or power &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>False advertisement. Did not come with remote or power cord. Cannot turn on the sound bar. Stay away.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-vizio-sb3820-c6b-is-a-nice-soundbar-at-a-nice-price">The Vizio SB3820-C6B is a nice soundbar at a nice price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We purchased this sound bar primarily to be able to hear voices more clearly when watching TV. We did not want a subwoofer like most sound bars have, so this fit our requirements and was a daily deal. This sound bar is definitely an improvement over the TV speakers and I am happy with my purchase. It is unfair to pay less than $100 and expect movie theater sound. I was impressed with just how loud this can get, especially when using Bluetooth (which is nice!). I purchased from Woot.com through Amazon and had no problems with missing accessories and everything was new quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-little-speaker">good little speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&rsquo;t compare too much with other surround sounds. This basically just amplifies my tv&rsquo;s sound. It definitely isn&rsquo;t high stereo or anything like that but is louder and is pleasant. If it were 2 or 3 hundred I would give it 3 stars, but for the price I gave it 5. Will it change your life or rock the world probably not. Is it a good speaker at a terrific price, you bet. Came very quickly too.</p>

<h5 id="should-of-known-better-what-a-waste-of">Should of known better, what a waste of</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I never buy refurbished items but thought with this being amazon, I would take a chance and sure enough out of the box the item wont power on&hellip; Should of known better, what a waste of time</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-time-with-this">Don&rsquo;t waste your time with this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your time with this. It does not work properly with the remote. It responds to maybe 1 out of 10 button presses. I even put my own new batteries in it, and that didn&rsquo;t help. Sometimes when you press the volume up button one time, it goes all the way up. Same with volume down. It sounds decent, but it is useless to me if it doesn&rsquo;t work with its own remote. I even bought a Harmony remote to use with it instead, and it didn&rsquo;t change anything. So, it&rsquo;s something to do with the unit itself, not the remote. I returned this and bought two brand new Vizio units, thinking it was the refurb part that made it defective. No dice. They all act the same way. USELESS! Wasted my time setting it up and returning it. It&rsquo;s just garbage. I&rsquo;ll never buy anything Vizio again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this to supplement my Samsung 50&rdquo; tv and it&rsquo;s been great! I bought this refurbished, but I&rsquo;ve had no issues with using bluetooth or connecting it to my tv!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-impressed">Not impressed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased a refurbished product. It appears one of the speakers doesnt work. The left side is much louder than the right side. Granted its an improvement from the TV speakers.</p>

<p>easy to install and great sound</p>

<p>Fantastic sound.. rivals Bose for less money&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="great-sound-poor-design">Great sound, poor design.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The sound is very good. Especially when you listen to a digital DTS channel. The bass is very good from a sound bar. I don&rsquo;t feel the need to have a subwoofer at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-sound-and-great-quality">Good sound and great quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sound solution for my living room.</p>

<h5 id="a-little-annoying-that-it-doesn-t-know-how-it-s-hooked-to-the">A little annoying that it doesn&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s hooked to the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&rsquo;t beat this for the price. A little annoying that it doesn&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s hooked to the TV and I have to cycle inputs at times.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sound-but-needs-a-powered-subwoofer">Great Sound but needs a powered subwoofer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought this soundbar in hopes of having it sound like our previous one that was hit by lightening. I&rsquo;m actually impressed by the clarity and cinema option.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-it">Worth it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This makes a big difference in sound even with a decent model Samsung HDTV. This greatly improves listening to music channels.</p>
