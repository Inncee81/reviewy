<h5 id="the-best-kindle-case-for-the-price">The best Kindle case for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case is wonderful! Is it the Cadillac of cases? No, what do you want for less than $20? What I wanted was an attractive case that would sit up safely and protect my Kindle against my fumble-fingered life. This case does all of that perfectly. The &ldquo;pop in&rdquo; type of case is, in my opinion, the only way to go. After using this type of case, all others seem clunky, awkward and frighteningly insecure.I can vouch for the protection this case gives. I was just walking through the house holding my Kindle. I didn&rsquo;t trip, didn&rsquo;t run into anything. Just randomly, for no apparent reason, I suddenly &ldquo;juggled&rdquo; my Kindle. It flew out of my hand, did a lovely in-air twist and landed HARD on my hardwood floor. The corner of the plastic holder (the point of impact) broke off. The Kindle itself was entirely unharmed. It stayed in the case until I picked it up and is fine. The Kindle will now not snap into the case so I ordered a new one today. Yes, the case broke. No, a $60 case probably would not have, but who wants to look at the same case for 5 years anyway? I like the occasional change in scenery. I got one with a tree on it this time. The point is, this case did the job I bought it to do- protect the Kindle. So I am paying another $17 versus replacing a $300 Kindle. Fintie case for the win.</p>

<h5 id="glad-i-decided-on-the-fintie-case">Glad I decided on the Fintie case!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was somewhat reluctant to order this case as there were no reviews at the time. I’m happy that I did. This case is perfect for me. I ordered the black case which I think compliments the Kindle very well. The case seems to be very well constructed and has a textured outer surface. The interior is a suede like material, which protects the Kindle. This case was designed specifically for the Kindle Fire HD 10 and has precise cut-outs which allows easy access to all the tablet features. The case clips on to the tablet securely, and I like the fact that there’s no frame surrounding the screen.The cover has a built in one piece easel which allows the tablet to be positioned at multiple angles.The case arrived quickly, and ahead of schedule. Very happy with the purchase.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-case-for-new-fire-10">Excellent Case for New Fire 10</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what I wanted for new Fire 10. I like the magnet that keeps it closed and Fire fits perfect. I like the way the Fire turns on when case is opened and off when closed. I ordered purple-it&rsquo;s a mauve purple and it&rsquo;s a nice color. I like being able to flip the open flap behind when using Fire. It&rsquo;s soft grey on inside which is perfect. It&rsquo;s very lightweight, but seems durable. The price is excellent for the case. 2-day shipping with Prime came on-time. I would buy again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="more-than-worth-the-money-to-protect-something-you-spent-so-much-money-on">More than worth the money to protect something you spent so much money on!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case is an exact fit for my kindle fire HD 10. It is great quality and durable. I have purchased this brand of case for a previous kindle fire tablet and still have the case four years later on that same kindle with nothing wrong with the case. This is a great brand and so far the new case I purchased has pleased me greatly. I love the sleep/wake feature. I also like that when you fold the cover into the triangle to use it as a stand the magnets connect and hold it together. This is an overall great product that is more than worth the money I spent on it. You will not be disappointed. The colors are great as well.</p>

<h5 id="top-notch-tablet-case">Top Notch Tablet Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was really surprised how nice this tablet cover is for the low price it is selling at. Very well made. Fits like a glove. I can&rsquo;t think of anything bad to say about it. I highly recommend it. I received it earlier that the date posted.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As advertised. No surprises or complaints.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="had-to-return-it-defective-magnets">Had to return it - defective magnets</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case arrived in a timely manner and I loved how my Fire snapped right into it. I got the mosaic one and the colors weren&rsquo;t quite as bright as I was hoping, but it still was a good overall case&hellip;until I discovered that the auto-wake-up of my device while in the case did not work as advertised. If I had the case cover all the way back, the device would not stay awake. I would swipe up to wake it up and the screen would automatically go back to dark. As soon as I took it out of the case, it would wake up just fine. I did some research and it looks like the magnets were likely slightly misplaced and interfering with the wake-up feature. I decided to return the case and get one from another manufacturer. I didn&rsquo;t want to risk having the same problem again. Customer service was great as I got a full refund for the defective case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-as-advertised">Not as advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Case fits well and would have kept it if it worked as advertised. It says it sleep/wakes the device but it doesn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want to wear the on/off button out ever time I want it to sleep or wake up. I noticed after I bought it a number of others had the same issue. I hope others read the comments first, if I had I wouldn&rsquo;t be shopping for a new case right now. Oh, if you are holding your fire in your hand, and you flip the case back, it is really flimsy and just drools down. No magnets to hold it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="have-had-this-case-for-all-my-kindles-3-and">Have had this case for all my kindles (3) and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have had this case for all my kindles (3) and it does very well. None have broken. All kindle s a different size.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="junk">Junk</h5>

<p>This thing is a piece of junk. The corners are breaking off and it has never been dropped or even bumped into anything hard.</p>
