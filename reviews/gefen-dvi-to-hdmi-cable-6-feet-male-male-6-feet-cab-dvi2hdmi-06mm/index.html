<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="like-many-new-tvs">Like many new TVs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this cable to connect a computer to a 1080p HDTV. Like many new TVs, mine has a VGA (aka &ldquo;pc&rdquo;) input, but I wanted to to keep everything digital so I needed to connect to one of the TV&rsquo;s HDMI ports (VGA is an analog connection). This cable works great and going form my computer&rsquo;s DVI port to HDMI means there is no analog to digital conversion going on.The cable itself is thick and sturdy and has solid connectors. My TV is mounted on an articulating wall mount and is pulled away from the wall on a regular basis (out for TV watching and against the wall for computer use). Have had no problems with the cable connectors coming loose. Quality product, excellent value. Don&rsquo;t spend tons of money on name brand cables, this cable works great. I also got a 2&rsquo; HDMI cable for around $3 to connect my cable box to the TV and it is working out just fine.If you are looking to use an HDTV as a computer monitor, I would highly recommend getting a 1080p TV. I was told that I would not be able to tell the difference between 720p and 1080p on a 32&rdquo; screen, but as it turns out that depends on how close you are sitting. For viewing distances &gt;5 feet you may not be able to tell the difference, but I assure you there is a BIG difference when sitting 4-5 feet away looking at a screen full of text. I returned my 720p and the 1080p I replaced it with is nice and sharp. Look great!</p>

<h5 id="works-great-and-can-t-beat-the-price">Works great and can&rsquo;t beat the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a cable for a video card that has DVI-I output to pump the signal to a TV for maintenance such as loading ESXI for VMWare and changing BIOS settings. This cable did the trick without any issues. The cable is very well built and has very good strain relief. The length was more than adequate for my use. For the price this cannot be beat. Just be sure that you need a DVI-D (digital) cable, and not a DVI-A (analog). I think people that typically rate this cable and others like it with 1 or 2 stars for not working do not know what they need. You have to have a DVI-D (digital) or DVI-I (digital + analog) to be able to use this. HDMI is a digital format so your video card has to be able to output digital, otherwise you would need a analog to digital converter. I considered buying a adapter instead of the cable but for a few cents more I got the cable. I doubt I will ever need this cable for anything else though so it was purchased for a very specific work need.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-don-t-be-rough">Works great don&rsquo;t be rough</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>worked wonderfully for a while.I have a monitor with a DVI port and a D-Sub port and no HDMI and all my laptop has is HDMI so i bought this and there are absolutely no issues with it until you use it a lot if you&rsquo;re like me and you have a laptop any you&rsquo;re plugging and unplugging often then the HDMI end doesn&rsquo;t like to stay in one piece it&rsquo;s not held by anything so after a while the connector just broke off into my laptop and shorted out my pc when trying to retrieve the damaged connector fortunately my computer was fine but i can no longer use the connector so if you plan on plugging it daily then this is not the cable for you but if you have something that you will rarely unplug then this cable will work great there is no issues with color, resolution, or compatibility.</p>

<h5 id="cable-box-to-rear-projection-tv-approved">Cable Box to Rear Projection TV &ldquo;Approved&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t review a cable like this without clearly considering it&rsquo;s price&hellip; I felt I was taking a small risk in planning to use this to connect from my new cable box (HDMI out) to my old but still perfectly functioning Hitachi rear projection HD (the jumbotron :-)) TVs DVI connector. I didn&rsquo;t want to spend $60 to connect my cable box, so I tried this out, and it&rsquo;s been working perfectly. Yes, the cable itself is thin, and the shielding is probably quite a bit less than the $60 cable&hellip; Shocker the $60 cable is better!! But digital is digital, and if it works, it works just as well as the $60 cable. The CRTs on the back of my TV don&rsquo;t seem to cause it any interference issues, and I suspect for most people it won&rsquo;t in their typical home applications. And for less than what people pay for a mochachino espresso latte whatever, you can get one and see if your can save yourself $55+.</p>

<h5 id="watch-netflix-on-big-tv-with-this">Watch Netflix on big tv with this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a cable that allows me to view netflix and other movies on my large tv. Who wants to watch movies on a computer monitor? Not me and I didn&rsquo;t want to pay more for a smart tv. I got this instead and now I can move my movie from my computer over to my 55 inch tv screen. It&rsquo;s great for me and my limited technology knowledge. At least I could figure this out&hellip; Actually my son helped me because he knows all this stuff.</p>

<h5 id="this-cable-caused-major-issues-for-my-system">This cable caused major issues for my system.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After receiving this cable I spent an hour trying to get my computer (a brand new dell Inspiron) to recognize the second monitor (which was attached with this cable), and when I finally got my system to recognize the screen, the image included many flickering pixels. Every time the computer restarted I had to go to the device manager and manually force the computer to recognize the second monitor. Long story short, I spent 2 HOURS on the phone with dell support after my system completely crashed as a result of drivers related to this cable.Once Dell restored my system, I came back to amazon and ordered the <em>slightly</em> more expensive Amazon Basics version of this same cable ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TH7T2U/">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TH7T2U/</a> ) and when I plugged the Amazon Basic version in, the second monitor was immediately recognized with no issues and no headache. Oh boy, do I wish I&rsquo;d purchased the Amazon Basic cable in the first place!I will be returning this Gefen cable, I wish they could give me back the 3 hours of my life I wasted attempting to make this defective product work and then fixing the issues it caused to my system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works">It works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quality cable, I used to display video on a pc. I like the build quality, the ends have nice connectors and the sheathing is thick enough where I am not worried about it. For reference both HDMI and DVI are digital cable types meaning there is no loss of data along the cable or in conversion from one type to another. For all digital cables there isn&rsquo;t a difference in the quality of the signal so as long as it works then you are getting the best signal, so the only qualities to look for are price and a sturdy design that won&rsquo;t break. I&rsquo;ve used this cable for over a year with no issues at all.</p>

<h5 id="no-frills-cable-does-the-job-cheaper-than-other">No-frills cable, does the job. Cheaper than other &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No-frills cable, does the job. Cheaper than other similar cables on Amazon. Note: this does not transmit audio, if anyone was wondering!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-on-mac-book-pro">Works on Mac Book Pro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used on a Macbook Pro to HP monitors with DVI input. For the Mac Book I also needed a couple of USB-C to multiport adapters to get the HDMI signal.</p>
