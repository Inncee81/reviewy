<h5 id="the-bebop-is-easily-worth-5-stars">THE BEBOP IS EASILY WORTH 5 STARS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>THE BEBOP IS EASILY WORTH 5 STARS, but not in it&rsquo;s current condition - I will explain.Background:I am not new to flying drones. My first drone was the DJI Phantom 2 vision plus - a much more delicate and breakable drone when crashed then the Bebop, but it is also bigger, a lot more powerful, takes better video quality, and originally costing about $400 to $500 more then the Bebop with a Skycontroller.Bebop Pros:*The Bebop is very durable for a drone and can take a good amount of crashes without breaking parts. This is huge, because as a new drone pilot you will crash, period.- and probably quite a bit too. Where with other drones, like the Phantom 2 Vision plus, parts will break (like the gimbal) and camera and that alone costs, about $600. to replace.*The Bebop&rsquo;s video is extremely stable and sturdy without a gimbal. This is huge too. No moving parts, less things that will break when you crash. Video quality isn&rsquo;t as good as say the Phantom 2 Vision plus, but it&rsquo;s well worth the trade to have a very smooth video - and I prefer the Bebop&rsquo;s technology for video stabilization then that of a gimbal.*Drone is pretty small. Some might think this is a downsize, but I found it a lot more convenient then with my Phantom. It&rsquo;s easy to carry from place to place. I have more confidence using this around my smaller kids, then I do with the larger Phantoms. It&rsquo;s less spicuous to use when out in public and in parks.*Skycontroller - The Skycontroller really is the only way to use the Bebop.It has decent distance and makes the Drone much easier to use.Cons - in this order:*Price - This is the biggest concern.With the introduction of DJI Phantom 3, they have set a new standard of quality and value for your money - like it or not. The Bebop with Skycontroller currently is $899.00. The Phantom 3 Advance is $999.00 and it is incredibly superior for only a $100.00 more. It&rsquo;s like buying a Moped for $899.00 or buying a Ducati for $999.00. Are you getting it now?*Skycontroller \ Price.The Bebop without the Skycontroller is really just a ridiculously over priced $500.00 toy.Sorry it&rsquo;s true. Without the Skycontroller you don&rsquo;t have the range or distance to really use the drone seriously.. Again, think of buying a Corvette but then being told you can never leave the Cul-de-sac (dead end street) that you live on with the Corvette. Ya, it&rsquo;s exactly like that. And if you want to buy the Skycontorller separately it&rsquo;s $400 and stupendously expensive - so no win here.*Cheaply madeFor $899.00 I&rsquo;d expect Parrot to make the Bebop drone feel like I was getting a block of gold, yet instead what I got feels very cheaply made as others have stated. 2 rubber landing gear lost on it&rsquo;s maiden flight. People have complained about this from the beginning and Parrot has done nothing to fix the wrong, at least with DJI, they came out with several versions of the Phantom 2 Vision Plus, in trying to correct problems and make a better drone, but not here with the Bebop. The battery connections has to be held on with a $0.25 Velcro strap. REALLY??? A $900.00 package and I am holding the battery to my Drone with a $0.25 Velcro strap. I would of respected Parrot more if they included a role of duct-tape, but then again that cost more then $0.25 and the price of the drone might of gone up another $50 bucks.*Lastly Flight time.With the stock batteries you&rsquo;re lucky if get 7 to 11 minutes of flight time. I&rsquo;m sorry, $900.00 not acceptable for the price when Phantoms are hitting 16 to 20 minute flight times and the Yuneec Q500+ (you can now get at $999.00) can do 25 minutes of flight time. 7 minutes, 10 minutes, really not enough time to set shots you want to take video of and or pictures. It&rsquo;s just ridiculous .Would I buy this product again? No, I just can&rsquo;t for it&rsquo;s price.As much I like the Bebop and in many ways prefer it over DJI&rsquo;s Phantoms for everyday flying and want to give it 5 stars, good common sense tells me, no way - just not worth the money. If the whole package, (Bebop and Skycontroller) was $500.00 I&rsquo;d still think twice in light of the Phantom 3 Advance, but at least it would be at a price point enough to temp me if I really didn&rsquo;t know any better and had no way of getting $1,000 to buy the more expensive drones. Remember, Moped or a Ducati. But then again, sometimes it just might still be worth the save $1000.00 for the Ducati then to buy a $500 Moped.Personally, I would like to see what Parrot does with the next version of the Bebop. hopefully they will learn some lessons and, they will price more line with what they are offering in compareds to the competition and make the product with more quality so it can feel like a premium product for it&rsquo;s price.</p>

<h5 id="great-drone-cool-features-but-will-it-be-your-dronie-drone-of-choice">Great drone, cool features, but will it be your &ldquo;dronie&rdquo; drone of choice?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve had my Parrot Bebop Drone with Skycontroller for about a month now and wanted to make my own review of it, some comparisons of it to the AR Drone 2.0 and some other comments.The Skycontroller has a very professional feel, the bebop drone itself is quite small, I actually like the look of the AR Drone 2.0 a bit better but I do like that the Bebop battery fits better into the bay by clipping and a Velcro strap.One thing I noticed is that the Bebop is a bit louder (Sounds like a loud bumble bee) than my AR Drone 2.0 was, not sure why but it’s noticeable if it’s hovering above you whereas the AR Drone 2.0 could be more stealthy. The Bebop drone, however, is more stable in flight and the camera stability and quality blow away the AR Drone 2.0.The Bebop with Skycontroller takes an extra minute or two to get up and running. You turn on the Skycontroller which then finds the bebop drone, then you connect your phone/tablet to the Skycontroller via Wifi and you’re ready to go on the Free Flight 3 App., Sometimes it takes a minute or two for all the connections to be made but following this order seems to be the fastest way to get up a running. GPS locks on pretty quickly for both units, I always turn the drone on outside so it can find GPS right away and set where it should return to using the “return to home” feature.Once up in the air the drone is stable and very easy to control. I have recently gotten it to its ceiling altitude of 150 meters (~500 ft.). It is definitely high but would like to fly even higher but haven’t found a way to do so. The live video feed sometimes struggles the further away I fly it but it is still flyable even if out of my line of sight for a moment or two. The other day I got it a bit too far away and was not able to see it, luckily the Bebop has the GPS “return to home” feature” I simply hit the button for this on the Skycontroller and I could see on the GPS map that it was heading back to where I took it off. I’m hesitant to trust this feature too much but so far it works well when I ensure the GPS indicates green on the Free Flight 3 App before and shortly after taking off. I get about 10 minutes of flight time with the included batteries, I recently bought an extended battery (1600 mah) and it does seem to add a few extra minutes to flight time.After landing, I download the videos I have taken during each flight from the drone to my phone by finding the “internal memory” category on the app and transferring the videos to my phone over the wifi connection between the two for viewing later. It usually takes about a 2 or 3 minutes to download 30 seconds of video just as an example.Overall I am pretty happy with the Parrot Bebop Drone. You get a nice package for the price and it is a good upgrade from an AR Drone. I would like to compare it with a DJI Phantom in the future but for now this is a solid choice for someone looking to spend a little less and getting extended range and a good camera all in one package.Pros:- Superior range with skycontroller- Skycontroller feels and operates very well- App has just the right amount of features / information- Drone is stable in flight, as is the video it records- &ldquo;Return to home&rdquo; GPS feature could be a lifesaverCons:- Louder than I expected- Takes longer than I&rsquo;d like for connection to app for flight- Live video during flight can be delayed and freeze- Only 8-10 minutes of battery per flight</p>
