<h5 id="fits-epson-2040-perfectly">Fits Epson 2040 perfectly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a white ceiling mount that was built tough and would fit my new Epson 2040. This projector mount fits the bill. It&rsquo;s build tough and meets what I needed and will definately suffice for supporting a 7 lbs projector. It includes all hardware with a ton of extra bolts and washers which are both plastic and metal. Like the popular Epson 2030, the 2040 &amp; 2045 only use 3 arms and this fits like a glove and should never need adjusted. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. Thank you VIVO.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-mount-for-the-money">fantastic mount for the money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Fantastic mount for the money! plenty of adjustment in all directions. Nice thick metal and a great paint job. The bottom legs can move in all directions to fit nearly ANY projector. I used the Optoma HD28DSE (also purchased on amazon. see my review on that) and even though that projector only has 3 mounting holes, this bracket still worked fine. My only issue (which is NOT the fault of the bracket really) was that I have HUGE subwoofers which shake the projector around like a rag doll (see video). They also shake the whole ceiling the projector is mounted too so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying, not really the mount&rsquo;s fault. If you have 8 18&rdquo;s in your home theater like me you may want to look around for a stiffer mount but in most cases this won&rsquo;t be an issue as the bracket is quite stiff. Adding some additional bracing fixed the shaking and I&rsquo;m really happy with this mount.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="includes-everything-needed-including-the-hex-wrench">Includes everything needed, including the hex wrench.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have temporarily used the mount to place the projector on a floor stand until we can mount it from the ceiling of our church. The plate, normally mounted from the ceiling, was screwed to the top of the stool. I had made an adjustable platen which was always needing readjusted befiore each service. I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of screws supplied with the mount. It took less than 20 minutes from start to finish including adjusting the projector alignment with the screen. To paraphrase a popular commercial &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a quality product for the price&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-vivo-vp01w-fits-the-epson-powerlite-2040-projector">The VIVO VP01W Fits the Epson PowerLite 2040 Projector.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had an aging Epson PowerLite 6100 home theater projector that started having auto-iris problems. I decided to replace it instead of getting it repaired. The PowerLite 2040 I replaced it with has a much shorter throw distance and projects upward instead of straight forward.Where I had the 6100 about 14 foot from the screen on a high shelf, the 2040 needed to be 8 foot from the screen and about waist height.I decided to mount the new projector from a door frame using a ceiling mount, and use the ceiling mount setting on the projector. This flips the image and projects forward and down instead of forward and up. I settled on the VIVO Universal Adjustable White Ceiling Projector / Projection Mount Extending Arms (MOUNT-VP01W). I was concerned that the mount might not work since the PowerLite 2040 has three mounting holes instead of four. I figured I would risk it for $11.99.I needn&rsquo;t have worried. The VIVO fit the projector easily. My only problem was mounting the base to the door frame. That wood was the toughest, hardest wood you could imagine. I nearly got blisters on my hand tightening the screws. The mounting kit includes various mounting hardware, but no wood screws. I bought them (#12 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo;) at the local hardware store for less that a dollar.The project was simple except for the wood screws, and the result is perfect. The projector is up out of the way, and the image fills the screen.</p>

<h5 id="great-and-simple">Great and Simple</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I purchased a ViewSonic PJD7720HD 3200 Lumens 1080p HDMI Home Theater Projector, I knew I would need a way to keep it connected to the ceiling. I didn&rsquo;t know what the heck I was doing, so I bought this one. It was very intuitive and simple to set up! It took me almost no time and I was able to do it with the tools in the box. It was simple. A total beginner could figure this out. Take it from a true beginner! It requires no mechanical ability whatsoever.A brief note&ndash; you&rsquo;ll need a drill. There&rsquo;s no way to screw this into the ceiling. Still, love it and would recommend this wholeheartedly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-product-for-the-price">Fantastic product for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic product for the price. All hardware is included. The large bolts require an 11mm nut driver, so if you were planning to install with a cordless impact, check your sockets before you get started. You can use a Philips, but if you are driving them into anything solid, (and you should) then you will probably round them out. Extremely easy to adjust. Would absolutely love a quick release for removing half of the bracket with projector. I&rsquo;m using it under the roof over my patio. Don&rsquo;t like leaving the projector outside. So taking off easier would be great. 1st world problems&hellip;..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sturdy-projector-mount-fits-my-irulu-10-projector">Great, sturdy projector mount! Fits my IRULU 10 projector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Came just as expected. Fits very well to my IRULU projector and multiple types of screws are supplied for various types of projector mounting types. The only negative I would say is that the instructions aren&rsquo;t as clear as they could be but one can figure it out no problem if they try. Not sure if they are supposed to come mostly assembled (top half and bottom half just needed to be connected to each other) but there was an opened bag with mine and the screws, washers and spacers were scattered throughout the amazon box (see photo). I did manage to find all the pieces I needed though. Just now noticed that Value max has the same mount for less. Mount-It! Ceiling Projector Mount Height Adjustable Universal Stand Fits Epson Optoma Benq Viewsonic Projectors, 30 Lbs Capacity (Short)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-hanger">Solid hanger.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good product for the price. Could use some notching to help stabilize the final location of the joints as opposed to needing to crank down on the bolts to hold the final position. Took some creative fashioning to get the legs to line up with the optima projector. No concern at all that it is strong enough and the adjustment is more than enough to get a good position on the projector. Does come with all necessary hardware too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-deal">Awesome deal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this mount worked fine for me. Already recommending to my friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="small-and-strong-and-easy-to-install">Small and strong and easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an extremely versatile projector mount! I had to install our projector on a slanted portion of the ceiling, and it was so easy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grate stuff. Thanks.</p>

<h5 id="great-adapter">Great adapter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great adapter which was easy to install and heavy duty. They give you plenty of hardware to go with it which seems to be able to accommodate any kind of projector.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This projector mount is terrible. The screws do not stay secure in the metal pieces, so the hinge mounts are always loose.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>
