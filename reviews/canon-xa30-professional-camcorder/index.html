<p>Wide DR Gamma (600%)
For natural and realistic-looking image capture that faithfully represents the scene at hand, the XA30 Professional Camcorder features a Wide DR Gamma mode. By suppressing overexposure in high brightness areas of the composition, this mode helps achieve a wide dynamic range of 600% to produce seamless tone gradations, resulting in smooth detail, accurate color and virtually no blown-out highlights.</p>

<p>Highlight Priority Mode
To capture highly saturated, realistic colors and to convey gradation characteristics as perceived by the eye, the XA30 Professional Camcorder has a new Highlight Priority mode that achieves effects similar to HDR modes in other camcorders. By reducing the mid- to high-brightness compression of the standard gamma mode, the Highlight Priority mode helps to prevent loss of detail in high brightness areas. Designed for display on a bright LCD TV, videos captured in Highlight Priority mode should be shown at a high brightness setting to help ensure accurate portrayal of the effect.</p>

<p>View Assist Function that Supports Highlight Priority Mode
When using the XA30 Professional Camcorder in Highlight Priority mode, the View Assist function increases brightness and medium tone gamma in the camera&rsquo;s viewfinder or OLED panel. This allows images to be displayed with the brightness and gradation with which they are being recorded or reviewed, helping to ensure the subjects look natural and realistic.</p>

<p>Intelligent Optical Image Stabilization System with Powered and Dynamic Modes and Auto On/Off
The XA30 Professional Camcorder offers a powerful optical image stabilization system suited to help reduce image blur in a wide variety of shooting situations. The different image stabilization options can be selected manually, or Intelligent IS can use an automatic detection system to identify the proper stabilization mode for the situation. Featured on the XA30 is Dynamic Mode, which provides electronic correction of roll and tilt.</p>

<p>Dynamic IS
Used for image stabilization at the wide end, Dynamic IS builds on translational (up-down/left-right) stabilization, adding roll axis correction, horizontal roll correction and vertical roll correction for five-axis correction. Image distortion is substantially reduced, even when shooting while in motion.</p>

<p>Macro IS
Macro IS corrects angular and shift-type shake in wide-angle shots.</p>

<p>Powered IS*
Used for image stabilization in telephoto shooting, Powered IS corrects for low-frequency camcorder shake.</p>

<ul>
<li>During Intelligent IS (AUTO mode), Powered IS can be set to ON or OFF.</li>
</ul>

<p>Full Manual Control
Custom Key and Dial
A Custom Key and Dial feature allows you to assign functions to an easily accessible key and adjust the settings with a control dial. The functions include:</p>

<p>Tv/Av: Use the dial to adjust shutter speed (Tv mode) or aperture (Av mode), as needed. In this mode the key has no effect.
Manual exposure: When manual control is selected, the dial can adjust aperture, shutter speed or gain. Select items to adjust, such as aperture or other settings, with the key.
Exposure Lock can be set on or off as can the AGC Limit.
Composition Aids
With the Level Marker feature, it&rsquo;s easy to keep the camcorder level for more accurate framing. The Grid Marker provides a reference grid in your viewfinder. Depending on the background color of your shot, you can choose between two different colors (white or gray) for better viewing contrast.</p>

<p>Gain Control
Gain may be manually set from 0 dB to 24 dB in 1 dB increments. Additionally, Auto Gain Control Limit allows you to set the maximum gain limit for the image sensor&rsquo;s sensitivity. With this function, brightness and noise can be balanced as required, and image quality can be maximized in low-light situations.</p>

<p>Power Zoom
Power zoom is available in Variable and Constant settings in 3 modes: Fast (approx. 1.9–60 seconds), Normal (approx. 2.5–180 seconds) and Slow (approx. 4.0–285 seconds). To provide added control, there are 16 predefined steps in Constant mode.</p>

<p>Ergonomic, Portable Design
Weighing less than three pounds including the detachable handle, battery and lens hood – and less than two pounds without – the XA30 Professional Camcorder is ideal for high-action shoots when both speed and mobility are essential, and where keeping a low profile is an added benefit. Though small in size, this camcorder sacrifices nothing when it comes to professional functionality. It features a “seesaw” style zoom lever, manual focus/zoom ring and joystick for easy control and an electronic viewfinder that can tilt up to 45° for low-angle shooting. It also has five Assign Buttons to help it fit to your operational needs.</p>

<p>Two Phantom-powered XLR Audio Inputs with Manual Gain Control
A stereo microphone is incorporated into the XA30 Professional Camcorder, as are two XLR audio inputs with +48 V phantom power. The built-in microphone provides outstanding audio in fast-paced situations while the XLR inputs provide connectivity to external microphones and other professional audio devices. If you choose, the built-in microphone and XLR input can be used simultaneously.</p>

<p>Audio is recorded in 16-bit PCM format at 48 kHz for amazing quality and fidelity. And both the built-in microphone and XLR inputs have the option for automatic or full manual gain control. To prevent variations in the recorded audio level, the dial can also be locked.</p>

<p>The XA30 also includes a 3.5mm headphone terminal with 16 volume settings for accurate audio monitoring.</p>

<p>Ultra Compact with Detachable Handle
A detachable handle provides the user with expanded audio performance and added flexibility. Removing the handle allows the camcorder to be made more compact for convenient storage when travelling. Included on the handle are the following terminals, controls and monitors:</p>

<p>Two built-in XLR audio input terminals with phantom power
Accessory shoe (cold)
External microphone holder
Manual audio level control
Zoom control and record start/stop button
Infrared light
Tally lamp
High Definition Peaking for Focus Assist
To enhance focusing capability, the XA30 Professional Camcorder provides Focus Assist. It includes enlargement, which helps in capturing your subject in razor-sharp focus. It works by providing a 2x magnification of your subject, which is automatically cancelled when you start recording. Also included is color peaking, which shows the shooting object&rsquo;s focused areas in actual colors.</p>

<p>Assignable Buttons for Custom Shooting
The XA30 Professional Camcorder is equipped with five assignable buttons so that the camcorder can be tailored to the specific preferences or needs of the user.</p>

<p>Button 1 is preset as AF/MF.</p>

<p>Button 2 is preset as Pre REC.</p>

<p>Button 3 has no preset.</p>

<p>Button 4 has no preset.</p>

<p>Button 5 is preset as Rec Review.</p>

<p>Improved Infrared Shooting Mode for Extreme Low-light Conditions (with built-in IR emitter and diffuser)
The XA30 Professional Camcorder features an Infrared Mode allowing the capture of video in conditions with little to no ambient light. Improved from the XA25 and XA20, it can shoot at brightness levels that are approximately 1.4 times more sensitive, and makes low-light capture capable by removing the infrared cutoff filter from the optical path. Its specially designed lens coating allows the infrared light to pass through to the image sensor. Additionally, the detachable handle of the XA30 features an infrared emitter with a diffuser to shoot appealing infrared imagery even in complete darkness. For nighttime videographers or law enforcement users, the benefits of a compact, high performance camcorder for shooting in such conditions are obvious. Without the need to add lights, the shooter can save time on set-up, or remain hidden from subjects. Also, the XA30 gives the option of recording in white or green mode.</p>

<p>Connectivity to Various Inputs and Outputs
Not only does the XA30 Professional Camcorder provide the user with incredible control over the image, it also provides immense creative freedom when it comes to inputs and outputs, including:</p>

<p>HDMI Output (HDMI mini connector, time code can be superimposed)

Bluetooth technology allows high-quality audio to be recorded from up to 164 feet away (50m), making it ideal for events, ceremonies and other situations that call for unobtrusive sound recording. With earphones attached, the WM-V1 Wireless Microphone can also be used as a two-way intercom, enabling more creative control, such as discreetly providing an on-camera subject with direction.</p>

<p>Advanced Display Features: Zebra, Color Bars and Test Tone
Color bars and test tone can be selected and recorded. The color bars comply with the SMPTE standard. -12 dB, -18 dB or -20 dB can be selected as the test tone.</p>

<p>Enhanced zebra pattern (70% or 100%) indicates “blown out” or high brightness areas to help you set the proper exposure.</p>

<p>The white balance control has six available presets selectable through a variety of day and artificial light conditions (Daylight, Shade, Cloudy, Fluorescent, Fluorescent H and Tungsten), as well as two manual white balance settings. Color temperature may also be manually set from 2,000K to 15,000K in 100K increments for more precise adjustment.</p>

<p>Impressive Slow and Fast Motion, including Interval Recording from 2x to 1200x
Slow and Fast Motion Modes allow the XA30 Professional Camcorder to record a different frame rate than the playback frame rate (only in MP4 recording modes), for a fast or slow motion effect during playback. Since the camera is recording real frames and modifying the playback rate, there is virtually no quality loss and maximum image quality is maintained. Additionally, interval recording allows the user to record frames at specified intervals, providing time-lapse recording of up to 1200x and slow motion down to 0.4x of the original speed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have to update this review once I have some time using my new XA30, but my first impressions are: &ldquo;Wow, where have you been?&rdquo; This thing is TINY for what it does - almost shockingly so - but it&rsquo;s loaded with capability. I&rsquo;m glad I sprung for this newer model, rather than settle for an XA10. I especially am happy about the dual card, dual format recording, so I can dump a 360p or 480p at the same time as full 1080p, to facilitate web uploads without transcoding, while still having full HD for editing. I&rsquo;m also very happy about the XLR audio inputs. I also picked this model because it will support the external zoom and recording control handle I have mounted on the arm of my Manfrotto fluid head.I would be a little happier if there were some unified way to get all the inputs and outputs without it looking like a pincushion (two XLR, HDMI video out, earphones out, power in). All those come from unique locations on the camera body. Oh, well. At least with it tripod mounted I don&rsquo;t have to hand hold it amongst all the wires.The auto white balance took longer than I expected to settle on new scenes. I&rsquo;ll have to see how it does in real use; panning from my kitchen warm LEDS and cool fluorescent lights to an out-the-window green forest probably wasn&rsquo;t a fair test.My only real concern is that I&rsquo;ll have to find some way to lock it down, since it will stay mounted on a video tripod in our church sanctuary. Since the handle is removable, the bicycle lock I had thru the handle of my older Canon won&rsquo;t secure it.At the same time as this camera, I also bought a Teradek Vidiu webcasting/streaming box. It mounts directly to the shoe on top of the handle. With both units self-powered, and nothing more than a single HDMI cable between them, after some setup on the Vidiu, I was able to walk around cordless and stream video straight onto YouTube Live. limited only by my network bandwidth. Very, very cool.</p>

<p> I made a short video to show off some example footage that I took with the XA30. I didn&rsquo;t show off the camcorder itself because there are some very nice professional videos available online that show off all of the connections and features. I just wanted to show off some of the video quality from this unit - and keep in mind that I was just using the &ldquo;Auto&rdquo; setting on the camera. I&rsquo;m about 50 pages into the 200 page instruction manual, and there are a lot of settings and tweaks that I haven&rsquo;t tried out, yet. Also, please consider that the video had to be compressed to get it to fit into a review, and then likely was further compressed by Amazon. So, unfortunately, it won&rsquo;t truly show off the quality of images from this unit.Before I get really started, though, I want to point this out: the only difference between the XA30 and the more expensive XA35 model is that the XA35 has an HD/SD-SDI connector. That&rsquo;s it. If you don&rsquo;t need that connector, don&rsquo;t even worry about spending more on the other model.There is a LOT to discuss with a (currently) $1800 camcorder, and I&rsquo;m likely just going to scratch the surface. Please feel free to ask me questions in the comments section, and I&rsquo;ll respond as quickly as I can (be sure to track comments, though, so you&rsquo;ll know when I respond).Truth be told, this is my first &ldquo;real&rdquo; camera or video recorder. Ever since I was a kid (and I&rsquo;m 43 now), I&rsquo;ve gravitated to compact cameras. From my Kodak Disc camera, to my compact digital cameras, to just using my cell phones (which are actually pretty good), I&rsquo;ve always gone with small. This XA30 has me seriously reconsidering that mentality. The optics on this are fantastic - simply fantastic. Yes, it&rsquo;s huge compared to a cell phone, but if you&rsquo;re shopping for this - you probably aren&rsquo;t serious about using a cell phone for your videos. This is a professional unit, and it lives up to it (said by a guy who isn&rsquo;t a professional :) &hellip;but it sure seems to have all the capabilities and connections that I think one would want).The 20x optical zoom is not only astonishing on its own, but the auto focus capabilities of this camera are phenomenal. I was shooting video of mountains over five miles away, and it was focusing in on them. The same is true for looking at homes on a foothill probably about three or four miles away (not shown in my video). I&rsquo;m used other cameras, from friends and family, with good optical zoom&hellip;but I&rsquo;ve never used one with such quick and accurate auto focus. I&rsquo;m sure that others have it, but I wanted to point out that the XA30 definitely does.One reason that I wanted to get this was the detachable handle that has two XLR mic inputs and 48V phantom power supplies (I LOVE that part). That&rsquo;s some serious additional capability, IMO. Unfortunately for me, the included mic holder is too small to hold my condenser mics, but I can still hook them up and run them on stands when I&rsquo;m recording with this on a tripod (speaking of which, the Amazon Basics tripod that I bought for about $20 is plenty sturdy to hold the XA30 in place). Fortunately for me, and you, is that the built-in mics are actually very good. When I record video on my Galaxy S3 cell phone in my kitchen, I get an echo from the room. On this, though, I&rsquo;ve never noticed that echo. That, and the mics are pretty sensitive with a good frequency response. No joke, the first five or so times I played back a video that I&rsquo;d made in which my pooch Ivory barked in an adjoining room during the video, I kept thinking that she was barking right then as I watched it because it was so realistic sounding. I still thinks it sounds like she&rsquo;s barking in the next room, but I know it&rsquo;s the video and not real life.The 3.5&rdquo; view screen does a really nice job, although it can be a bit difficult to see outside in the sunlight. You can adjust the brightness of the screen to offset that, though. The touch screen on mine is accurate in terms of where I put my finger, and it makes it convenient for selecting menu options without having to go through the knob control on the back side of the unit. As you probably expect, the image on the view screen auto adjusts for the screen orientation as you swivel it around into place, so you never have to worry about the image being upside down relative to the camera.The first images that I took with this were at night in my living room that was illuminated with my overhead light fixture. The room isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;d call &ldquo;dim,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s not daylight bright, either. On the attached view screen, the images looked simply stunning. The next day when I viewed them full size on my computer monitor, though, I could see what seems like the tell tale signs of low light images with the poor signal-to-noise ration and dots on the image. I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;d yet set the camera to &ldquo;Auto,&rdquo; though, so that might be my fault. I was expecting better low light images, though, given that the product is specifically marketed as having improved performance in that area. If I manage to get better images, I&rsquo;ll update this portion of my review.The IR image capability is quite good. You&rsquo;ll need the handle attached to use the included IR illuminator (it&rsquo;s on the front of the handle right under the &ldquo;Canon&rdquo; logo), or you&rsquo;ll need separate illumination, but the camera&rsquo;s sensor does a good job. I have some $150 IR security monitors that do a similar job, but it&rsquo;s great to have that capability built into a unit like this that does so much more.Things that I haven&rsquo;t yet tried but am looking forward to are: (1) WiFi capability, (2) dual SD card use that allows you to store videos in two different formats/quality settings, and (3) assignable buttons and knob. I love that you can store a high quality video, and also create at the same time a lower quality version that would be perfect for internet streaming (for example). The many assignable buttons and knob allow you to assign your own functions to several of the controls on the camcorder to make it even more convenient for how you want to use it.I struggle to find any real criticisms for it. Yes, it would be nice if it came with a storage/carrying case and a spare battery, but it comes with everything that you need. It&rsquo;s truly a five star product, IMO.Again, please feel free to ask any questions in the comments section. I know that there&rsquo;s a lot more to the XA30 than I discussed here. Thanks!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a film artist and i&rsquo;ve read all the other xa30 reviews up until 6/8/16 and this is what i feel is positive/negative about the xa30.First off i own the xa10 and love it! So this is abig upgrade over the xa10.For me the 20x zoom is big! I wanted to see if my cannon 1.5x teleconverter would work on top of the 20x telephoto and it does! I did&rsquo;nt notice aSignificant drop in quality at least for things within 100 yards.The internal sound is much better than the xa10 not the the xa10 was bad.Video quality was stunning! And capturing in lowLight is unbelievable! I really could&rsquo;nt believe how well i could see at about 9:15 at night in early june.This just feels like a super solid camera if your not going to spend like a ka-jllion dollars .I didn&rsquo;t like the lack of the internal 64 gigs or theThe way the xlr cables unlock from the camera handle.I haven&rsquo;t used every camera out there but this isA really solid one and i recommend it!</p>

<h5 id="awesome-camcorder-awesome-features">Awesome camcorder. Awesome features.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this camcorder as an upgrade from my phone! There are plenty of inputs for what I need and the video quality is fantastic. The dual card slots are great for duplicate videos in order to have a backup, or for having plenty of space for video. The auto-focus is honestly way better than I expected, and the face tracking is a nice feature.The only problems I have had are remembering to turn the handle unit on to get the audio from the XLR inputs. That is totally user error and just serves as a reminder to anyone who may buy and use this camera to make sure the switch is turned on before videoing. The other problem I have had is with the microphone holder. The shotgun mic I purchased to use with the camera is no big enough to properly fit into the holder. I am relatively new to videoing, though, and should have looked into the exact sizes.Overall I am very pleased with the camcorder and highly recommend it!</p>
