<h5 id="sucks-the-life-out-of-batteries-can-t-douse-the-nite-light">SUCKS THE LIFE OUT OF BATTERIES, CAN&rsquo;T DOUSE THE NITE LIGHT</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I found this product on the company&rsquo;s website in the &ldquo;camping&rdquo; section, that suggested more rugged, durable products. Here&rsquo;s what I found:1. The two switches (light and fan) on the top of the fan are not clearly marked, so it&rsquo;s easy to mistaken one for the other and not get desired settings.2. The LED has three settings: bright white, white, and an orange nite light which is rather bright. But I cannot turn off the light. Makes no sense for us in a camping situation.3. The unit goes through batteries much more rapidly than the website description indicates. Standard batteries lasted only about 11 - 12 hours with fan on &ldquo;high&rdquo; and rechargeables about half as long.I returned it.</p>

<h5 id="great-portable-fan">Great portable fan</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this because of it&rsquo;s portability, it conveniently folds up into 12 x 13 x 3 inch (no it&rsquo;s not square). This not only makes it easy to store but to take any where you want including the trunk of your car. There are so many uses for this besides camping: at your desk, in your car especially when sitting idle and you don&rsquo;t want to run the engine, outside for a picnic and more. I actually use it when I have to grill under the eve of the house on a rainy day, it helps push the smoke away. I say it helps, the fan works but it&rsquo;s not incredibly powerful.- There are two speeds for the fan and three different light modes: yellow, half white and full white.- The light switch goes from off to yellow, half, full; but the fan off is in the middle of the two speeds. Consistency would be better&hellip;- Works great with a 9v AC adapter but even with the adapter the fan loses a little bit of power when you turn the lights on.- You can adjust the position from flat to 90 degrees.- The adjustment is a plastic catch which will wear out the more you adjust it. And sounds like it would&hellip;- The lights rotate 180 degrees to shine behind as well.Overall, I really like this fan because it is so easy to move. While I probably won&rsquo;t use them often the lights are a nice feature to have, makes it a more useful tool. And it will work even if you don&rsquo;t have access to power.</p>

<h5 id="well-designed-compact-and-a-nice-camping-accessory">well designed, compact and a nice camping accessory</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The O2Cool fan is well designed, folds for transportation and has built in lights which pivot. I think it is a great camping accessory, but used as a portable, it requires 5 D cell batteries which add to the weight considerably, and they only last 24 hours in active use. That should be adequate for a weekend camping trip if you do not have it running <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. and the light is bright and very useful (and also does not draw as much power)/ It has a good basket to protect fingers, and 2 speeds, though I found that the low speed, on battery. was not every effective. It is a good size to keep comfortable in a tent when the weather is hot, and can keep down mosquitos outside.It can also be used indoors with an accessory cord, which does not come with the fan. as such I was not able to test it. On a/c power it should be very efficient and would work well as a desk fan if you have hte space for something this size. (My desk is always embarrassingly full).My only issue with this fan, and the reason for the 4 star rating, is the cost of running it on 6 d cell batteries.If, however, you like creature comforts when you are camping, the fan is well made, folds flat and is very light weight. I like it, but would love it if it did not require all those batteries.</p>

<h5 id="lit-up-and-breezy">Lit up and breezy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the sort of fan you&rsquo;d bring if you&rsquo;re in the backwoods, but for car camping it&rsquo;s great. I tend to be a fair bit addicted to white noise when I sleep and I sleep warm, so having a fan has been a nice luxury. I&rsquo;ve had another more basic model that&rsquo;s worked fine, so was excited to have this more feature rich.First, the fan is a bit higher pitched but puts out a nice breeze, it&rsquo;s not quiet even on low, which is fine for me. And low setting provides a steady wind without draining the batteries. High puts out a lot of wind, is pretty loud, and so would be used only in specific cooling down times (not for constant use).The lights are really a nice addition. When I car-camp I always have a bit too many odds and ends of supposed comfort, so having everything here in one makes things easy. Great for in the tent or on the table, the lights have 3 settings, of orange (1 light), white (more daylight tone) with 3 lights on each side (half the bar), and white with six lights covering most of the bar. Both sides have light bars and both light bars can turn 180 degrees. Which is great so that you can direct the lighting where you want it and use indirect lighting as desired. The orange light, I presume, is better for keeping night-vision and less bug-enticing.The stands fold down separately so you can put this on uneven surfaces without worry.All plastic build, and while it doesn&rsquo;t have a separate handle, it has a slot at the top that serves as a good hand hold. Everything is pretty straightforward in controls. Light switch on the left on top, fan switch on the right. Light progresses from orange, to low, to high in one direction. Fan is high switched one way and low switched the other, with off in the middle.Battery compartment is in the feet, making for a very steady base. Easily accessed. Doesn&rsquo;t come with batteries, but that&rsquo;s to be expected. That it doesn&rsquo;t come with a power supply is more irritating, as it is sometimes tricky to match up the right kind. They don&rsquo;t have any provided instructions or guidance on which one to get either, which adds to the irritation. Fortunately, I have a lot of power supplies, and the first one I pulled out of the box fit perfectly and worked great without heating up. Outside the plug input on the fan is listed 9 VDC 900 mA, and my switching power supply I used is listed as 12V and 3300 mA.Again, while batteries are easy to match, a power supply is a lot less so, and I&rsquo;d expect more company guidance about it if they aren&rsquo;t going to provide one. For the cost of this fan, that would not have been a big issue, so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m taking off a star.Other than this, I&rsquo;m a fan of this fan.</p>
