<p>High Resolution, Highly Advanced Performance
16.0 Megapixel sensor
With the camera&rsquo;s 16.0 Megapixels of resolution, your images are rich and clear, with textures and tiny details faithfully reproduced even at the long end of the 5x Optical Zoom. This high level of resolution is ideal for creating the largest prints, and allows you the flexibility to blow up and crop any section of an image to express your creativity.

With each successive generation, DIGIC processors have brought elevated performance and powerful new features to PowerShot digital cameras. The DIGIC 4 Image Processor has ushered in a new level of picture quality and accelerated processing, making possible features such as high-speed continuous shooting, HD video and Face Detection Self-timer.</p>

<p>Zoom in on Wider, Steadier Shots</p>

<p>5x Optical Zoom with 28mm Wide-Angle lens delivers stunning images
The 5x Optical Zoom (35mm equivalent: 28–140mm) in the PowerShot A2500 digital camera delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. It gives you a great range of potential images from a single location, which is perfect for sporting events and other occasions when your shooting stance is fixed, or times when moving in too close might disrupt the action you&rsquo;re trying to capture. The lens&rsquo; 28mm wide-angle perspective puts more image in every frame for dynamic, exciting shots.</p>

<p>A Smarter Camera Means Better Photos
Smart AUTO
Photographers of all levels appreciate a camera – especially a go-anywhere compact digital – that takes the hassle out of capturing beautiful images. The PowerShot A2500 gives you Smart AUTO – sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. Smart AUTO automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using 32 predefined shooting situations. The camera then makes optimal settings to ensure the best possible image capture when shooting still images. Smart AUTO also includes Advanced Subject Detection, which allows the camera to detect and track non-human moving subjects like animals and vehicles. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.</p>

<p>Shooting Modes/Special Scene Modes
Smart AUTO  The camera automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.
Program The camera automatically and intelligently selects the aperture/shutter speed combination based on the shooting conditions.
Live View Control   Enables Brightness, Color, and Tone adjustments to your images using easy-to-understand controls.
Digital IS  The camera digitally corrects image blur by analyzing the subject prior to choosing the best correction method.
Portrait    Brings the subject into focus while beautifully blurring the background.
Face Self-timer The camera waits for a face to enter the frame before releasing the shutter.
Low Light   For high quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations.
Fisheye Effect  Now you can get the fisheye effect – a classic photographic distortion – without a fisheye lens.
Miniature Effect    Give images a miniature look with an effect that emphasizes perspective by blurring the top and bottom of the image.
Toy Camera Effect   Simulates photos taken with &ldquo;toy&rdquo; or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect.
Monochrome  Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia, or Blue.
Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors.
Poster Effect   Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts.
Snow    Shoot clear snow scenes without darkened subjects or an unnatural bluish tint.
Fireworks   Create brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks.
Long Shutter    Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography.
Movie   Record video; unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode.
Gorgeous HD Video From Your Still Camera
Shoot brilliant 720p HD video
Using the pocket-sized PowerShot A2500, you can shoot high definition video anytime, anywhere. With a simple push of the dedicated movie button, you&rsquo;ll be able to instantly record every moment in motion. 720p HD video is smooth, vivid, and beautifully lifelike, making it an ideal way to capture special memories. In addition to being able to shoot 720p HD video at 25 frames per second, the PowerShot A2500 can also shoot 640 x 480 VGA video at 30* frames per second.</p>

<p>*Actual frame rate is 29.97 fps.</p>

<p>Dedicated movie button for easy video capture
It&rsquo;s never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. To make shooting video as natural as snapping pictures, the PowerShot A2500 has a dedicated movie button. No need to plan ahead, no need to search through menus on the LCD screen; when you feel a moment would be best captured in 720p HD, simply press the button and recording begins. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want.</p>

<p>Say Goodbye to Blur</p>

<p>Digital IS reduces the effect of camera shake and subject movement
Digital IS beats the blur that mars many shots by recognizing the main subject, then automatically applying the camera shake correction that best suits the situation. If the subject is a person, blur reduction processing is performed. For landscapes, cityscapes and other still scenes, the camera takes three quick successive shots and composes them into a single clear image. If the subject is moving, the camera takes three successive shots, then automatically saves the clearest image.</p>

<p>A Charge that Lasts as Long as a Memory
New ECO Mode helps reduce power consumption for longer battery life
The PowerShot A2500 takes energy conservation to the next level with ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated via a dedicated button for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. ECO Mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed so you won&rsquo;t miss the moment. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the evening, ECO Mode on the PowerShot A2500 makes sure your camera keeps up.</p>

<p>More Ways to Get Creative
Scene Modes
Scene Modes are fun, easy ways to give your shots a distinctly artistic feel without the need for any extra lenses and filters. Super Vivid heightens and saturates colors for eye-popping intensity. Poster Effect eliminates gradations between colors for an illustrative feel. Miniature Effect enhances perspective in a scene, blurring the top and bottom to make it look as if it were created with miniature models. You can also make a quirky portrait using the Fisheye Effect or add a beautiful single-tone effect with Monochrome. Toy Camera Effect simulates a vintage look as it capturing the photo using a &ldquo;toy&rdquo; or pinhole camera.</p>

<p>Help You Won&rsquo;t Need Help to Find
Help Button
The PowerShot A2500 digital camera is designed to be fun and easy to use, even for beginners. A Help Button on the camera&rsquo;s exterior brings up the help menu any time you need it, right on the LCD screen. From here, you can scroll through a variety of topics that answer your questions with clear explanations, offer helpful shooting advice, and show you diagrams highlighting the position of any buttons you&rsquo;ll need.</p>

<h5 id="good-point-and-shoot-entry-level-camera">Good point-and-shoot entry level camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this yesterday and like it, had Canon PowerShot A2300 IS 16.0 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom (Black) before. Just to note, PowerShot A2500 is an entry-level pocket camera which is very similar to PowerShot A2300: 16-megapixel <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.3&rdquo; sensor, DiGiC 4 processor, and 5x zoom 28mm wide angle lens, 2.7&rdquo; LCD. Even 720p HD video capabilities are the same.Pros:1. What really distinguishes it from its predecessor is Smart Auto Mode recognizing 32 shooting environments and adjusts settings for better quality. It automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on the environmental factors (lightning I guess) to provide point&rsquo;n&rsquo;shoot simplicity.2. 16.0 Megapixels, with loads of resolution pictures are still clear. High resolution is also good for producing biggest printouts.3. 5x Optical Zoom is sufficient in most cases.4. DIGIC 4 Image Processor. Not as fast as DIGIC 5 though fast and powerful enough to give you advanced system options, provide quick-shoot with reliable performance and low battery consumption. As far as I know DIGIC 4 is currently Canon&rsquo;s most efficient processor for budget cameras. BTW it has some Eco mode, that is said to be providing even faster warm-up times and saves the standard battery, but I haven&rsquo;t tested it yet.5. Very lightweight, just put it into your pocket, can take it everywhere.6. Price tag - $99. You can&rsquo;t get any better camera for the price.Cons:1. Like A2300 it lacks optical image stabilization, though it&rsquo;s got digital image stabilization.2. <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.3&rdquo; sensor. Well, entry level CCD providing good pictures, not of a DSLR quality, that&rsquo;s all I can say.Summary:Sure this is not the best camera in the world. I definitely knew it when I bought the camera. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of pictures I shot.If you&rsquo;re like me (not a pro) and looking for a budget point-and-shoot camera taking family photos and events, mostly shoot in daylight or good lighting, I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it, taking into account its price tag of $99 - just about right.</p>

<h5 id="good-camera-for-the-price">Good camera for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my 6th point and shoot (P&amp;S) camera in 9 years, ranging in price from $200-$300. I have had 1 Bell &amp; Howell, 3 Nikons and this is my 2nd Canon P&amp;S camera. The last 2 P&amp;S cameras I had I literally wore out by taking so many pictures. I bought this as a second camera for my husband (who doesn&rsquo;t usually take pictures) to use when he goes hunting with my son. I chose a Canon because I have a Canon DSLR and love it. I also wanted an inexpensive camera, because I thought it would sit on the shelf for most of the year. Of course it did not come with a memory card, as I have yet to buy any camera that does.To test this camera, after shooting indoors for a bit, I took it to the park. Luckily, what started out as a sunny day turned cloudy, allowing me to test the camera in different lighting. This is a typical low priced P&amp;S camera. Like all P&amp;S cameras, this one performs best in bright, outdoor lighting. However, the ease of use and quality of pictures for the small price tag makes this a good buy. This is one of the better P&amp;S cameras I have had.Although no instruction manual was in the box (other than the very basics), it was easy to figure out how to manually set this camera, which is a must for me. I liked the fact that it has a PROGRAM setting, which allows me to set a program manually. Even if I switch to another setting, it saves my manual settings, allowing me to switch back and forth between settings. That was great when I tested it, because the lighting went from sunny to cloudy and back again. I could easily switch from AUTO to LANDSCAPE to PROGRAM (my manually programmed settings) and back, depending on lighting and activity, all while holding my 6 month old. The pictures I took while holding my baby (who was trying to grab the camera) of my 4 other children who were riding a moving train turned out surprisingly good. I also manually adjusted the ISO to 1600 and took some shots while holding my squirming baby, and the pictures were not as noisy as I thought they would be.This is a great camera for the price. I would definitely recommend it for anyone, especially those who are ready to do some manual adjustments to get better pictures, but not ready to spend a lot of money. I am glad I bought this camera, and I am happy because I think I will actually use it more than I originally thought!</p>

<p>I like the &lsquo;one button&rsquo; record on the back of the camera. When the power is on, you don&rsquo;t have to switch between photo and record, just press the record button. Takes great photos and video, but I wish it had a way to switch to 480p video when the 720 isn&rsquo;t necessary. Otherwise a nice camera.</p>

<p>This is probably the 4th of this Canon series we&rsquo;ve owned, as we seem to need an upgrade every other year (pick-pockets in Buenos Aires, etc).The camera is affordable, easy to use, yet versatile (a good blend for two people with different skills).I will say that our visits to ocean-side have shown the camera to be a bit sensitive to water (ocean spray and it lost power) and sand (one tiny grain froze the lens motor). However, Canon has been generous, leaning towards 2 free camera repairs that was partly my fault because of this (here is the word of mouth they are hoping for!). The repair is a breeze with self-printing labels and email status.Oh and those sunset pictures from Costa Rica are priceless !</p>
