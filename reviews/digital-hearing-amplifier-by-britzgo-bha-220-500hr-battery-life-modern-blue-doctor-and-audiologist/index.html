<h5 id="very-good-and-easy-to-use">Very good and easy to use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second hearing amplifier of this style I have used. I find this one superior in many ways. The universal ear feature, fits either ear. is great and eliminates the need to search out the proper unit to fit the ear. The power switch is far superior to the open battery compartment. Because of their size , the same on all amplifiers, the controls , volume and tone are easy to use but I recommend the user spend some time using them against a constant sound to become familiar with their range. I found running water from a sink tap provides a constant sound.Finally to date, I found that the hearing amplifier is sturdy and well built and can handle a certain amount of abuse, dropping, etc without impairing their function. I would endorse their purchase by anyone with a hearing loss problem. They compare favorablywith much more expensive units.</p>

<p>I kid you not! I paid $6,000 for two sets of hearing aids &ndash; one that I could wear while swimming in the pool and the other for all other times. They worked fine but my hearing in my right ear went fast and soon I could not use either hearing aid at all. Instead, in 2012, I purchased 2 sets of Sennheiser listening devices with a Radio Frequency Sender that you attach to the TV and a Dongle that hangs around your neck and let me listen to the TV all over my apartment and out on the balcony when earbuds were attached to the Dongle. Recently, I began attending a very small but very special church and I was having so much trouble hearing the service that I decided to try a hearing amplifier. I knew I had made the right choice as soon as I opened the super nice case. The medium size dome was already on the amplifier so I tried that first and worked with the 4 modes and the sound level of the TV until I had an acceptable voice coming in my ear from the amplifier, but soon the medium dome was bothering my ear &ndash; it was in too far and when I removed it, it would turn inside out. I then tried a smaller one and it was so small that it let air get into it while I had it in my ear and that caused a loud piercing whistle &ndash; bad, very bad. I really did not expect the large dome to work, but when I tired it, like Goldilocks in the perfect bed that was just right, that dome was the perfect dome and was just right. The voices coming in my ear were clearer and suddenly I was connected with the world again. I had to practice adjusting the three switches on the amplifier so I could do it while it was positioned on my ear, and the 4 modes of operation controlled by the top button that you push really do have a huge effect on the sound &ndash; it is important to get that correct and when you have it just right it makes a lot of difference. I found that with the large dome the voices sound different than with the other two domes and when I pushed on the mode button and also adjusted the sound of the TV, I could get a really good sound that without having voices run together or garbled. When I went downstairs to pick up my evening meal, I could hear my footsteps as I walked through the halls and I could actually hear the woman who was standing in line behind me say something to me and respond. I was so happy as I walked back down the hall &ndash; I just felt more connected than I had before &ndash; in fact, I never felt this connected with the expensive hearing aids. I can hear my voice again and that was a big problem to me because that was causing me to have problems communicating with people. What I could hear sounded so strange it affected my feelings about myself and caused me to lack confidence in the way I was coming across to other people. I have had the TV on all day because in order to get used to listening to sound through the amplifier and I have checked the TV&rsquo;s sound level throughout the day because I wanted to make sure it was not so loud it would disturb my neighbors. Each time I checked the TV was down so low I was constantly amazed by the fact I could hear it in the kitchen, bathroom and one of the bedrooms. After a day&rsquo;s use, the sound is clearer and the words are no longer running together and I can really enjoy the TV without wearing a Sennheiser Dongle around my neck. I can also hear the water running in the sink, the toilet flushing, answer the phone without removing earbuds, One day I was talking to a maintenance man I had called when I found water all over my floor in the corner of my bathroom. There was a lot of water in the corner and it had been absorbed by the wooden cabinet and now the cabinet has to be replaced because it has rotted on that end. I could not hear the water leaking from the handle of the special low flow toilet and c did not see the water pooling in the corner because it was hidden by the bathroom trash receptacle. I was so upset by this and almost cried because I could not even hear water running full blast in the sink and had to be careful to check that it was off before leaving the room. If I heard a strange noise in the apartment, I had to walk all over each room trying to find out where the noise was coming from and then try to identify it and when that was impossible I just had to check everything to see that nothing was happening that was connected to the noise that was dangerous. Jeff Bezos and Vohorn thank you so much for bringing this amplifier to me. You have definitely changed my life in only one day. I can hardly wait for Sunday to be able to interact more with people in church and more easily hear the minister&rsquo;s message.The batteries last a long, long time according to reviews, but I am going to order a large supply as soon as I catch up on my reviews. I do not want to go a day without using my Britzgo Hearing Amplifier. Note: I am practically deaf in my right ear and it does not help that ear at all, but I have a hearing problem in my left ear that is not severe and it really helps that ear. Also, not having amplified sound of the problems in my right ear no longer interferes with the sound in my left ear.. I am not bothered by movement, paper noises or anything like that when wearing the amplifier. I feared I was throwing my money away again, but now I wish I had never messed with expensive hearing aids. When you get the right setting on this amplifier you will know it and you will definitely be happy again. My hair is just long enough to cover the hearing aid, but I would not mind if everyone saw it &ndash; I love it that much.</p>

<h5 id="close-but-no-cigar">Close&ndash;but no cigar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This came in a nice case, was relatively easy to use (once I figured out how to put in the battery),and was reasonably comfortable to wear. (I was worried at first, because some people complained it did not fit in their ear. I have trouble putting ear plugs in my left ear&ndash;the only one that works now&ndash;but the smallest earbud fir perfectly.) It also worked quite well, and battery life appears to be very good. It was a revelation to hear many things again. My hearing has been slip-slip-sliding away for years, and I didn&rsquo;t notice the full extant of the loss.On the negative side:1) This is a simple amplifier of ALL sounds. Hence, a loud sound is much LOUDER.2) There is a lot of annoying high frequency sounds in a noisy place.3) I could not adjust the unit to compensate for these defects. The lowest volume setting was too loud for a noisy environment. There are four program settings, but they all sounded the same to me. None cut out the annoying high frequency noises.In a quiet area this hearing aid worked perfectly, and helped me to hear clearly, especially conversations. But as soon as I got into any kind of noise, I was bombarded with high intensity, unpleasant sounds. I either had to turn it off, or (more commonly) I pulled it out of my ear and stuffed it into my pocket. Or so I thought. Coming back from a trip I found my pockets empty&ndash;I had lost the hearing aid.I will not be buying another. After extensive research I have ordered a Siemens Lotus 23P. It costs nearly three times what the Britzgo did, but has features that will make it much more useful: digital signal processing, noise and feedback cancellation, and most importantly&ndash;automatic gain compensation/compression. (That is, soft sounds are amplified, but loud sounds are not, or less so. After all, I have no trouble hearing loud sounds. They do not need to painfully loud.)</p>

<h5 id="what-a-godsend-and-a-winner">What a godsend and a winner!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I saw this product I was wary. I was looking for my 95 year old mother who has age related hearing loss in her right ear. She didn&rsquo;t want it. I ordered it anyway thinking it might help before we went to the audiologist and paid 4000.00 for hearing aids. It arrived earlier than I expected, well packaged and in it&rsquo;s own nice case. It felt extremely solid and well made. The instructions are simple and I DO mean simple and easy to follow. I put it on my mom&rsquo;s ear on the lowest volume setting that was the default right out of the box. She was instantly amazed. She could hear me speaking in a normal voice even from another room which hadn&rsquo;t been possible in years but best of all she could hear clearly and at a normal volume her TV and her beloved music. I would love to send our thanks and appreciation to this company for making an affordable and wonderful product. I will be telling everyone I know and see about this product. Just to see her smile when I was talking in a normal voice and just to not watch my windows shake when she tried to watch TV is worth gold ;) Thank you again Britzgo&hellip;you are a winner!</p>
