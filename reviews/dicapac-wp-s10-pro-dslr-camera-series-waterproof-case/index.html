<h5 id="gets-the-job-done-with-caveats-review-with-photos-included-in-link">Gets the Job Done - with Caveats (Review with Photos included in link)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The review includes photos of how to install the camera in the bag plus photos from the two locations I used the DicaPac in Bermuda with my 5d Mark IIII and 16-35 f2.8L. As I did not have a proper underwater housing for my 5d3, I got into a tiny lather because I did not know what to do in regards to taking a snorkeling trip in Bermuda with my dSLR. Logic would dictate that the best thing I could do is rent a proper underwater camera housing as I cannot justify the expenditure on a product that I will not use frequently. Because I am me, and hardly logical at all, I opted to put approximately $5,000 worth of photographic gear in to what is essentially a glorified $50 dollar Hefty bag. Just how do you think this is destined to work out??? Well, I do not want to ruin this for you, so please read on&hellip;<a href="http://www.nwpphotoforum.com/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=41762Please">http://www.nwpphotoforum.com/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=41762Please</a> note that the review contains tons of photos of how to use the bag properly in addition to photos that show what you can actually do with it. Given that I am a novice snorkeler, I was pretty pleased with the image quality&hellip;but there are caveats that are necessary to read.**Please come back and indicate if you feel this review was useful to you or not. It was designed to be very comprehensive.</p>

<h5 id="will-need-patience-and-practice-to-make-good-photographs-the-fact-that-it-is-a-bag">Will need patience and practice to make good photographs. The fact that it is a bag &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Much less than a professional grade DSLR underwater camera housing. Will need patience and practice to make good photographs. The fact that it is a bag and not a solid structure, there is constant movement of the camera inside the bag. Also there is only one finger access to the controls of the camera. So you better have all your settings figured out before entering the water. All being said this is still a good value for any DSLR photographer that wants to shoot underwater.</p>

<h5 id="shoot-on-manual-focus">Shoot on manual focus</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was a bit nervous putting my 5D Mark III in this, but i used it a fair amount underwater for a week and it worked great. No leaks. The deepest I went with it was maybe 5-6 feet, i wouldn&rsquo;t trust this for anything deeper but did get a couple good photos out of it. Was kind of hard to use but you will get the hang of it.I&rsquo;d recommend putting the lens to manual focus as it kept searching for focus underwater with it on auto. Also, the viewfinder becomes useless inside this case. Sometimes the glass interfered with the front of the lens for the shot but just hold it out of the way and it works.</p>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my husband and he was very happy with it. I wouldnt suggest submerging it all the way in water without doing a leak test first. We did a leak test and had no issues. But its great for being at the beach or areas where there is a lot of moisture. The first time he used it was in the water taking pictures of surfers. The pictures came out great. I only gave it 4 stars because of how bulky it is and can take some getting use to when trying to press the shoot button on the camera, but it does work really well and is still a great product. It was packaged well and shipped on time.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-very-easy-to-get-to-the-controls-and-adjust-the-lens">it&rsquo;s very easy to get to the controls and adjust the lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for a trip to Hawai&rsquo;i to protect my Nikon D-90 while snorkeling. Works very well and doesn&rsquo;t leak! (do the leak test first, though) It&rsquo;s a little tricky to get the camera in the bag, but once it&rsquo;s inside, it&rsquo;s very easy to get to the controls and adjust the lens. You do have to be careful to not change the positioning of the lens once you set a shot, but there are little finger pouches on the lens barrel that allow you to control it. Really enjoyed using this and it makes for great underwater shots you can&rsquo;t get with an iPhone in a pouch.</p>

<h5 id="works-like-a-charm">Works like a charm!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this bag specifically for underwater shots on my vacation this past summer. I followed all of the directions carefully including performing an underwater test without the camera in the bag, with no problems. The bag isn&rsquo;t perfect, I couldn&rsquo;t manually focus the lens, and it was difficult to keep the camera lens in the center of the glass on the front of the bag (a few shots had a black line on the edge due to the seal blocking the lens). But for the most part, it helped me take great underwater shots of coral, fish, and giant sea turtles. The turtle photos were so good that I had them printed to canvas and they are now hanging on my wall in my living room.I&rsquo;m truly happy with this product in spite of some of its small shortcomings and feel confident in recommending it to others. It isn&rsquo;t perfect, but for the price of this compared to &ldquo;fitted&rdquo; underwater adapters in the $1000+ area (more than my camera), these minor inconveniences are acceptable considering the quality of underwater shots it helped me to achieve.</p>
