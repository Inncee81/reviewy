<h5 id="solid">Solid!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had my 60&rdquo; Goalrilla up for a few days now. My family loves it! Even the Mrs. who had her reservations. We&rsquo;ve been out in the driveway playing everyday after work, it&rsquo;s been great for the family. All the neighborhood kids are now in my driveway (not a bad thing). The other dads in the neighborhood that have similar goals noticed the black trim right away and love the look, looks just like a professional hoop. It was a beast to install (dug the hole and did the concrete myself) but I understand why and was worth it. This hoop is solid!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="let-the-trash-talking-begin-awesome-product">Let the trash talking begin! Awesome product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I may not be able to play basketball very good but everyone will think I&rsquo;m a professional with this in my backyard! THIS THING IS AWESOME! It is a heavy duty, beautiful, high quality product. It came with everything but the concrete, consumer friendly assembly instructions made it an easy and fun project. I still have to finish laying my court and I can&rsquo;t get that done fast enough. I was fortunate enough to have a tractor with a post hole digger and a front bucket, this allowed me to install it all by myself. This system looks great and truly compliments my property. I&rsquo;m excited and looking forward to playing basketball with my adult children over the holidays. I also put up the light so I can play at night, maybe my neighbors won&rsquo;t see how bad I am until I get some practice in.Keith A. Herrenbruck - Boonville Indiana</p>

<h5 id="high-quality">High Quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything about this basketball hoop exceeds expectations. Easy to follow instructions. Everything went where it was supposed to how it was suppose to. Quality finish. Looks spiffy. Buy one. Your kids will thank you and you&rsquo;ll always know where they are.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-goal-on-the-market">Best goal on the market!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Talk about awesome this is it. Our new goalrilla goal was super easy to set up. It came in two boxes with all the hardware and we were able to get it put up in no time! The frame and back board are thick material and looks to be as sturdy as any other goal on the market. We have bought goalrilla products in the past and the quality is second to none( especially at this price). We like the fact that the adjustable height makes it perfect for our growing family. We look forward to teaching our kids this great game for years to come!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-sturdy-and-stable-design">Excellent sturdy and stable design!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We couldn’t be happier with our new goal. It’s strong, sturdy and looks &amp; plays like a professional goal. All of our kids love playing on it and our oldest son is using it to get his game in shape for the upcoming basketball season. Great product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-brand-that-you-can-trust">A brand that you can trust!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This goal is the real deal. I&rsquo;ve had some Goalrilla goals in the past but this one is the best I have every seen or used. It has a very sleek new black trim on the backboard compared to my neighbors. It is also very sturdy and easy to adjust. I have had it for a week and it has gotten my entire family outside to play on the driveway again. I highly recommend this goal for any family.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="another-awesome-goal-from-goalrilla">Another awesome goal from goalrilla.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This goal is exactly what my family needed. It plays great and looks even better. This new design has a beam connected straight to the rim which looks very professional. The goal showed up in two boxes that were easy and quick to assemble. This is my second goalrilla goal and I will never own anything else.A+++++++ design, you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>
