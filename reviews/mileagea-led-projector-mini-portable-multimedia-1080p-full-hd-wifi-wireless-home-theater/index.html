<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-customer-service">Great customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this projector since we want to watch movies on the ceiling when laying on the bed :) the projector exceeded my expectations.Don&rsquo;t reply on the wifi feature since it does not work with my iOS 9 devices. The hdmi works perfectly.The remote of my projector does not work . But customer service is very helpful to lend a hand. Jean reply emails very quick. Four stars for the projector and plus one for the service</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-money">Great for the money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t go wrong with this projector for the money! The picture is amazing, it is easy to use and set up! Internal speaker isn&rsquo;t bad but isn&rsquo;t great. I use a external speaker with it, just make sure that you have the projector volume turned up all the way when connecting it through the AV jack to get the most out of the sound. The fan is somewhat loud but nothing that takes away from the movie you are watching. All and all this product is a definite recommend, we use it for outdoor movies for the kids while camping or in the back yard.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-amazon-awesome-projector">Amazing Amazon, Awesome Projector!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First I would like to thank Amazon for its amazing customer service. They really outdid themselves this time in comparison to the numerous great orders I have made with them in the past. The projector ordered on Friday was showing delayed for some reason in delivery and I requested customer care to help me as I was traveling soon. The representative was very kind and offered to help me find alternatives. Since I was keen on this particular projector, I thought out that I wont be able to take it to the trip with me considering the delay. She arranged for a follow up call on Monday to see if she could help me after dispatch. To my surprise it arrived the very next day on Saturday, I was really happy!!Now coming to the review : The projector is really worth the money. I really liked the quality. The build is good and the focus is also sharp with minimal blur at edges. It has USB, HDMI and SD card support. I ran it with USB. It played the movie in the USB very well. I was pleased with its lag free performance. However it has difficult wifi setup and needs Miracast configuration to work with. I tried to pair with my iphone, but it did not work in conventional methods (I was able to use DLNA by using some 3rd party app which streamed very slow with frequent lags). I would suggest using Chromecast for this and will update how it went. It has inbuilt speakers which is pretty decent, but would definitely use external speakers for a good home theater effect. Since the projector is designed for table top, using the right height, distance and angle would really help take advantage of focus and throw ratio. Overall I am pleased with the purchase. I would recommend this cost efficient projector for anyone who would like to stream media or use it for small presentations.</p>

<h5 id="this-projector-works-wonderfully-even-in-a-slightly-dim-room-no-need-for">This projector works wonderfully, even in a slightly dim room&ndash;no need for &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This projector works wonderfully, even in a slightly dim room&ndash;no need for total darkness! Plus I&rsquo;m happy that it accepts so many digital format input formats: computer, USB, HDMI, flash drive, &hellip; you can even use the WIFI option to project stuff on your smartphone! Since it is lit by LED lights, it won&rsquo;t get hot, and the bulbs will last practically forever!</p>

<h5 id="awesome-projector-also-how-to-set-up-wifi">Awesome Projector&hellip; Also how to set up WiFi</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow!!! Blown away by how nice this device is for the priceCompactDVD resolutionSharpNice image/Nice ThrowEasy set upMake sure you buy some Triple AAA batteries for the remote! Had to run to the store to get some..For those with MAC/iPhones wondering how to set this up with the WiFi feature&hellip;.1) Connect to the Projector first on your device. Settings -&gt; Wifi -&gt; Description will be LINK and some numbers + password will be 12345678. On OS X this is System Preferences -&gt; Network then search for the LINK network inside of networks or use the WiFi icon at the top right of the screen2) Afterwords go to your browser ( Safari on Mac devices ) and type in what it displays. 192.168.49.1 was mine -&gt; Load it3) Choose the top option to Scan and then choose your WiFi that you normally connect to. Make sure it says connected4) If you running OS X then you should see the Airplay icon appear at the top right of the screen. Choose LINK and then it should go ahead and start playing your entire screen. You can also choose applications like iTunes/VLC and send your Airplay information to send directly. I found that it was easier to just Airplay the whole screen. Same goes for iOS&hellip; you need an application that runs Airplay like iTunes/VLC/InFuse and it should send right overHope this help some of your guys!!</p>

<h5 id="the-quality-is-no-problem">the quality is no problem</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I mainly use it to project videos ,cause it&rsquo;s not good to project TXT or presentation just as the description .I have used it several times ,there is no problems .I hope the lamp life can actually be 20000 hours .only time can tell .</p>

<h5 id="works-for-price-but-volume-not-loud-enough-even-with-external-speakers">Works for price- but volume not loud enough even with external speakers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While this works, picture coloring not great. My biggest complaint is the fact that even with external speakers, we can&rsquo;t seem to get the volume to go up so all can enjoy. My review would change, if that were possible. Still waiting for much needed guidance from the company.</p>

<h5 id="delivery-portability-worth-your-penny">Delivery/portability &amp; worth your penny!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To start, if your looking for a projector for commercial/business use then look elsewhere.HOWEVER if you want a good semi-portable projector for the kids room or den then you won&rsquo;t be disappointed!..As for the seller here they delivered above my expectations!..Same day shipping was placed at 10am &amp; received the package at 5pm (on Labor Day to boot).As for the projector the best image will be had at 6-7ft if gaming. For movies or other video content at a 11-13ft range the projector did a great job for its price point.If this is your first projector &amp; want something thing that&rsquo;s worth your money then I would most definitely recommend this.</p>
