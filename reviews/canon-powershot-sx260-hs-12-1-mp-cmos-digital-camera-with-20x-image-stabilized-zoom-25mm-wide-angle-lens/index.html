Capture It All
The fact that the PowerShot SX260 HS digital camera is an ultra-slim camera with a powerful 20x Optical Zoom, Optical Image Stabilization and 25mm Wide-Angle lens is only the beginning of its attractions. You&rsquo;ll see detail you never thought possible through the huge zoom and wide-angle lens, while the camera&rsquo;s 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor deliver the rich, clear low-light performance that is the hallmark of Canon&rsquo;s HS SYSTEM. 1080p Full HD video in stereo is more beautiful than ever, with new high-resolution, high-speed processing. Sophisticated advancements include improved Smart AUTO that optimizes settings for 58 predefined shooting situations, Face ID that prioritizes pre-registered faces, and GPS for tracking and recording your shooting locations.</p>

<p>Astonishingly Slim
Ultra-slim Camera with powerful 20x Optical Zoom, Optical Image Stabilization and 25mm Wide-Angle Lens
At just over 1-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches thick, the PowerShot SX260 HS is an ultra-slim digital camera with a powerful 20x Optical Zoom. But because its lens embodies the quality and legacy of Genuine Canon Optics, its advantages go far beyond making the camera slim enough to slip in your pocket and carry anywhere. With a range of 25mm â€“ 500mm (35mm equivalent), the lens gives you the power to capture the full breadth of scenes, with details you&rsquo;ve never captured before. Images are bright and vivid with spectacular clarity thanks to Optical Image Stabilization.</p>

<p>Optical Image Stabilizer
Handheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon’s Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.</p>

<p>UA Lens Technology
Pioneered by Canon, UA Lens technology makes possible compact lenses with remarkable optical performance. By using molded glass with an ultra-high refractive index in aspherical lens elements, Canon has succeeded in reducing lens size while significantly reducing image aberrations. Another stellar example of cutting-edge Canon optics, UA Lens technology helps make PowerShot digital cameras pocket-friendly and capable of astounding image quality. 
Experience the Power
Canon HS SYSTEM
The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC 5 Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 12.1 Megapixel Canon CMOS sensor in the PowerShot SX260 HS incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of ISO 3200. The Canon HS SYSTEM thus lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur.</p>

<p>Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor
The latest-generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor brings phenomenal increases in processing speed and power. Improved chip architecture and algorithms deliver greatly expanded functionality with further refinement in image quality. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. Enhanced i-Contrast performance adjusts differences between light and dark areas to achieve even more natural-looking results. The faster processing speed also results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor also makes possible a new, highly advanced automatic white balance system. Whereas conventional white balance makes an overall adjustment based on a single type of light source, the new Canon Multi-Area White Balance analyzes several areas of the image to determine whether different adjustments are needed, for example, for the main subject and the background.</p>

<p>Memorable Moments in Spectacular Full HD
Canon Full HD Video Advantage
In addition to the Canon HS SYSTEM, the combination of the advanced CMOS sensor and DIGIC 5 Image Processor in the PowerShot SX260 HS makes it possible to shoot crisp, clear high definition video. Imagine the fun and excitement of being able to shoot spectacular 1080p Full HD video with stereo sound that you can later watch on your HDTV or download to your computer to share with family and friends. In addition to being able to shoot Full HD 1080p video at 24* frames per second, the PowerShot SX260 HS can also shoot 720p HD video at 30** frames per second.</p>

<p>Dedicated Movie Button, Wind filter feature and Optical Zoom for easy video capture
Itâ€™s never been easier to shoot videos with a PowerShot digital camera. The PowerShot SX260 HS has a dedicated movie button that lets you start and stop recording instantly. There is no need to go through layers of menus or operate switches or dials to switch to and from video recording mode. The camera is always ready to shoot stills or video whenever you want. The PowerShot SX260 HS also incorporates an electronic wind filter, which suppresses wind noise that can muffle or distort the sound. And unlike less sophisticated point-and-shoot cameras, the PowerShot SX260 HS lets you use the full range of optical zoom when youâ€™re shooting a video.</p>

<p>HDTV playback via HDMI output and CEC
Itâ€™s easy to enjoy and share the videos you shoot with the PowerShot SX260 HS. Simply connect its HDMI terminal to your HDTV using an HDMI cable. And because the PowerShot SX260 HS supports HDMI-CEC technology, youâ€™ll be able to control the playback of your images and videos on any CEC-enabled HDTV using the TVâ€™s remote control. (CEC – Consumer Electronic Control – is part of the HDMI specification, enabling components in a system to communicate with one another.)</p>

<p>iFrame
With the PowerShot SX260 HS, you can also shoot video in the AppleÂ® iFrame format, which is a computer-friendly standard that speeds up importing and editing of videos. It keeps file sizes small, making it more convenient to upload or e-mail high-quality videos. The iFrame format enjoys native support in compatible Mac and Windows video applications, making it unnecessary to perform time-consuming and often quality-degrading conversions.</p>

<p>A Smarter Camera Means Better Photos
Smart AUTO
Smart AUTO for the PowerShot SX260 HS has been significantly expanded, making it easier than ever to capture the sharp, bright, colorful images – and videos – youâ€™re looking for. By assessing various factors in both the background and the subject, the system recognizes 58 predefined shooting situations and automatically selects the camera settings that will yield the best possible results. Simply frame the shot you want, and in dozens of common or challenging scenarios the camera takes care of the rest. Hard-to-capture shots such as moving subjects, night scenes, backlit subjects, and landscapes at evening or on a bright snowy day are instantly and effortlessly captured as â€œkeeperâ€ shots. Smart AUTO makes the PowerShot SX260 HS ideal for capturing excellent quality still images and video on the go.</p>

Face ID
Face ID is one of the most advanced and exciting new features of the PowerShot SX260 HS, giving you an easy way to improve every shot of the people you love. Simply take a picture of up to 12 faces you would like the camera to register, then enter names and ages. Once a person is registered, the camera will pick him or her out of a group (even against a busy background) and adjust focus and exposure to his or her face, even recognizing faces in profile. Face ID is particularly great for shots of babies and children. The system can pick your baby out of a group of children, focus on your baby when pictured with an adult, and capture her best smile by taking three successive images when the smile is detected. The flash is even disabled so as not to startle the baby and interrupt the moment. Older children in motion are tracked, with focus and exposure continually adjusted with Servo AF; with one shutter press three successive images are captured so the best shot is never missed. And because you&rsquo;ll identify each face you register, Face ID makes it easy to search images by name.</p>

<p>A Steady Image Is a Beautiful Image
Intelligent IS
The latest advance in Canon Optical Image Stabilization technology, Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make the most effective IS settings to assure the steadiest possible image.</p>

<p>Normal Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.</p>

<p>Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.</p>

<p>Macro (Hybrid) Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.</p>

<p>Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.</p>

<p>Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.</p>

<p>Tripod When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.</p>

<p>The Ideal Traveling Companion
GPS Technology
The PowerShot SX260 HS digital camera is equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS)* technology. Now you can travel the world and let the camera automatically record the locations and local times of your stills and videos. The camera can also use the GPS unit to automatically set the exact time. You can maximize the usefulness of the GPS feature by using the special bundled Map Utility software that makes it fun to share the memories of your world adventures. In addition to displaying all your photos&rsquo; locations on a world map, the camera&rsquo;s GPS system can also track your route from photo to photo – a great way to visualize each trip! You can also create and share custom maps and personal mini-travel guides with friends and family members.
*In certain countries and regions, the use of GPS may be restricted. Therefore, be sure to use GPS in accordance with the laws and regulations of your country or region. Be particularly careful when traveling outside your home country. As a signal is received from GPS satellites, take sufficient measures when using in locations where the use of electronics is regulated.
This software uses Google Maps for displaying maps.</p>

<p>Versatile Still and Video Shooting Options

<blockquote>
<p>I received my SX260 last Wednesday and have taken about 700 shots and a few quick 5 minute video. Without writing a novel, here are the high/low points of this unit. In addition to this unit, I also purchased a couple of aftermarket batteries (and after market A/C adapters for about $5.00 each) for about $5.00 each and the batteries work fine. With the battery (original and aftermarket) I was able to get over 300 shots (50% flash) with zooming and playback and the battery meter still showed about 25% charge remaining.Pro&rsquo;sZoom - very long for a subcompact camera 20x optical, total 81x combined (yes 81 times!)Image Stabilizer - Excellent (far superior than the DSC-HX9V); Even at 81x the picture did not come out of focus, but of course not as sharp. I think it&rsquo;s still acceptableScenes - A few scenes; I think the portrait, sepia, B/W works real well (the Portrait+ suppose to blur the picture a bit, but it&rsquo;s not to my liking) It has a few effects (fish eye, toy, miniature) that&rsquo;s very effective and can be fun for creative shots.Auto Mode - was able to pick the correct type of scene almost all the time; it has an easy mode, and smart auto. Not sure why they have an easy mode, but the smart auto works greatSize/Weight - very compact and weigh&rsquo;s 8.2 oz. I would have prefer if the lens was flushed with the unit, but at 20x it may not have been possibleUniformity - the unit does not feel cheap, and beautifully curved; no sharp jagged cornersGrip - the right side of the camera has a nice plastic strip for easier gripControls - Dial extremely easy to use with one hand. The other buttons, if you&rsquo;re a previous Canon user, it&rsquo;s a no brainer; the menu and setup are practically the same across all their models.Screen - 3 inch TFT LCD screen very beautiful; nuff saidProcessor - Didn&rsquo;t notice that much difference between the DIGIC 4/DIGIC 5, but compared to the DSC-HX9V, this camera is like a Ferrari.GPS - Camera has it, but I never used it and probably won&rsquo;t; at least for the time being. Am more interested in a camera that takes excellent pictureCon&rsquo;sVideo - compared to the Sony DSC-HX9V this Canon comes in a distant second; if you plan on using this primarily as a video recorder, look elsewhere. I think Sony has excellent lens on their camera but their processing technology is clumsy, painfully slow and unacceptable; whereas with taking videos, the Sony does not do any processing (not to mention it captures at 60fps compared to Canon&rsquo;s <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> fps) This is one thing I will miss dearly.Flash - not sure if there is a good place but I had to change my grip as the flash is on the top left corner. Couple of times, I had my left index finger on the flash and the camera gave some flash error message and had to power off and power on the camera to reset the flash.If you&rsquo;re a casual or intermittent photographer (or a professional wanting an everyday point and shoot camera without carrying a luggage everywhere) that is interested in looking for a well refined point and shoot camera, yet has manual controls usually found on higher end DSLR (or higher end point and shoot camera), this is it!UPDATE 04/14/2012 - I paid $349 and today I noticed it&rsquo;s selling for $299, a 15% price drop in less than a month! I thought cars depreciate quick &hellip;UPDATE 04/18/2012 - The Live Mode works great! For those hard shots (for example, taking indoor picture with fluorescent lighting and without a flash), you can view the screen and make the adjustment right then and there. You look at what you plan to take, compare it to the SX260 LCD screen and press the shutter button.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am an experienced amateur photographer and I&rsquo;ve owned many cameras over the past 40 years. I&rsquo;ve had some photos published but photography has always been strictly a hobby, though a serious one. I shoot with a Canon 7D, Rebel backup, various &lsquo;L&rsquo; lenses, and I also use an Olympus E-P1 occasionally as well as a Canon S90 and Powershot 1100S (kept in my glovebox for &lsquo;emergencies&rsquo;). I enjoy taking pictures.I also enjoy traveling and have traveled around the states as well as visited many foreign countries. I&rsquo;m sure I echo the frustrations of every photographer out there when I say that choosing which photo equipment to take on a vacation is the most agonizing process in planning a trip.Let me share two experiences&ndash;one pleasant, another frustrating. In 2003, I visited New Zealand and took one of Canon&rsquo;s first digital Powershots. It was very small, fit in my pocket, and I could easily whip it out for quick photos. Even though the pictures were not pristine SLR quality, it was easy and fun using that camera and I still enjoy viewing those photos today. I had a pleasant and memorable trip. Second experience: a 10-day tour of China in 2007. I took a DSLR and 3 lenses as well as an HD camcorder, all in the same shoulder bag. It turned out to be total frustration. Instead of being able to enjoy the moment of seeing all that glorious ancient history and the people of China, I was overly concerned with &lsquo;getting the shot&rsquo; &ndash; all the time. Also, HD video was new in those days and I thought I could record the &lsquo;trip of a lifetime&rsquo; with the latest technology. But switching between video and still photography simply added to my frustration. Although I got quite a few good pictures and videos, I did not enjoy that trip as much as I should have because I let my photo-taking desires get in the way of my vacation needs and cultural immersion. As a matter of fact, my wife used a point-and-shoot to get some great candid photos of people and children that totally outshone my efforts.OK, fast forward to 2012. Like so many other photographers out there, when traveling I need a camera that&rsquo;s pocketable but can do everything. Impossible. It doesn&rsquo;t exist. But I remember the lessons learned from the experiences described above. Concessions must be made. With experience, I&rsquo;ve learned what is a necessity, and what &lsquo;would be nice to have&rsquo; when traveling. I have concluded that for me, a camera that takes &lsquo;very good&rsquo; pictures, that is small and lightweight, is a NECESSITY. Anything else would be &lsquo;nice to have&rsquo; but is not worth the enormous hassle.I&rsquo;ve had the Powershot SX260 HS for about a week now and I think I may have found the camera that will adequately meet my travel needs. I&rsquo;ve shot a couple hundred photos and I&rsquo;m surprised at the results. They are sharp, contrasty, colorful, noiseless, and good enough to use as desktop pictures on my 24-inch monitor without editing. The 20x lens is coupled to a shake-free technology that is very, very good. It&rsquo;s pocketable and has easy to use buttons that are logically placed. Canon has done their homework in finding the right balance between sharpness and noise, as far as I am concerned. Although it doesn&rsquo;t shoot RAW (that&rsquo;s a debate for another time), I am very happy with the JPEGs and I use the included highlight-taming technology built in to the camera and it works very well.What I like:1) Pocketable. Pocketable. Did I say pocketable?2) Turns on quickly to get the shot.3) 20x lens &ndash; 25mm to 500mm. The 25mm shots are corrected internally for distortion and the 500mm shots are sharp thanks to the IS technology.4) Very good noise control &ndash; I haven&rsquo;t tested it at 1600 or 3200 but several other review sites reveal surprising, low noise photos at those ISO levels.5) My copy is very sharp &ndash; no need to sharpen the photos it produces.6) Color accuracy is on par with my Olympus E-P1, which I consider to be the paragon of color accuracy.7) Full manual when desired.8) Takes very good HD video &ndash; though that doesn&rsquo;t interest me so much these days. IS corrects for camera shake in video mode and zooming works well.What I don&rsquo;t like:Nothing yet, though I will update this review if anything comes up.Does this camera take pictures comparable to my 7D? No. My E-P1? Very close. My S90? Superior to the S90 in my view.The 20x zooming feature of this camera can&rsquo;t be overstated &ndash; it&rsquo;s wonderful.So many reviewers nitpick about technical matters. Sure, I could do that with any camera, including this one. But the point is&ndash;what need does the camera serve? All I know is this: If this camera had existed at the time, the SX260 would be the camera I would have taken to China.Highly recommended.[UPDATE: Many people have asked me about the so-called &lsquo;squeal&rsquo; in video mode. When ambient sounds are low, the condenser mic (as in all cameras) boosts the gain. Most cameras will then pick up the internal motor/electronic sounds. This camera is no exception. The noise I&rsquo;ve noticed is a very subtle high pitched ring similar to tinnitus. Am I surprised? No. It&rsquo;s the same sound I&rsquo;ve heard in every video unit I&rsquo;ve owned in the past 25 years. Medium to loud sounds will cause the mic to adjust and the tinnitus disappears. Folks, if video is important, buy a dedicated video camera. This is a PHOTO camera that has video capability, which is what I wanted.]</p>
