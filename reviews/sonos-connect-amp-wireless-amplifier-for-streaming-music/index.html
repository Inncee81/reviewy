<p>Review from Home Theater Magazine
Review from HomeTheaterMag.com: Sonos
 It&rsquo;s hard to overstate the simplicity of the Sonos system concept. There are three basic Sonos bricks: two audio players (the ZonePlayer 90 and ZonePlayer 120) and one handheld wireless Sonos Controller 100. The Bundle 150 includes one of each.

<h5 id="brilliant-whole-house-audio-system">Brilliant Whole House Audio System</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am using Sonos differently than most people do. I have used five Sonos Connect:Amps to create a whole home audio system using built in ceiling mounted speakers.To start with, about six months ago I installed one Sonos Connect:Amp for my outdoor speakers around our pool, and it has worked very well for us. I have it connected to four outdoor speakers around our pool, the kind that look like rocks.I used 10 gauge outdoor wire to connect the Sonos to the outdoor speakers &ndash; the kind that is used for outdoor lighting and is designed to be buried. This wire is made from finely stranded copper, and is easy to work with. So the Connect:Amp is loaded to 4 ohms (two 8 ohm speakers on each channel), and it works well. More than loud enough for us.This got me thinking that Sonos Connect:Amp units would greatly simplify our whole home audio system. Our home was previously equipped with a very expensive, high-end, whole home audio system that is not user friendly.But the speakers were good quality Boston Acoustics ceiling mounted speakers, all wired back to the equipment in our a/v equipment room at one end of the house.Previously we had to use a control that is installed on the wall in each room that has a set of speakers to select the audio source (CD player with 5 CD tray, ReQuest Audio Server (photos attached), and iPod), change volume, turn on or off, etc, but we had to go to another place to select the music. I would rather be able to control all parts of the system from one place, and our phones, tablets, and computers are the perfect way to do this using the Sonos app. I have attached a photo of that control device &ndash; it is the device with 12 buttons.So now we can play Internet radio or music from our NAS, control the volume, etc., and it is all done from the Sonos app, which can run simultaneously on as many devices as you need. This way we can choose what we want to hear in any room, control the volume, turn the audio on and off, all from any phone or tablet, or my iMac, whatever.Since we have a large library of CDs that I have ripped to iTunes and stored on a Synology NAS, I am ripping that high-end clunky system and replacing it with, to start, 4 Sonos Connect:Amp units, installed in the equipment room where the whole home audio system equipment is presently located, which is where all the wiring from the various speakers around the house terminates.I will probably purchase several more Connect:Amp units to complete our system as we originally had a 12 zone system, although we never used it in some of the rooms it was installed in.This is not a cheap replacement for the old system, but for someone starting out would be much less expensive than installing the typical whole-home audio systems that the professional audio/visual companies charge over 5 figures for. I see large systems using Sonos Connect:Amp units as potentially economically disruptive to the professional whole home audio business.I have found the sound quality very good for the CDs I have ripped using Apple Lossless, and have not had problems with any audio drop out when playing from my NAS. Since all 5 of my Sonos Connect:Amp players are in the a/v equipment room, I have them connected to my network via Ethernet cables. Same with Internet radio, although a few times one of the stations my wife likes to listen to was obviously having problems with their stream.The Sonos app works well; we have over 3,500 songs in our iTunes library (all ripped from CDs) and have created various playlists.Some time ago I merged our two (wife and me) iTunes libraries into one library and using the various sort options in the Sonos Music Library it is easy to find an individual cuts of music if that is what I want to do.Hope this can help anyone considering a whole-home audio systemUpdate July 2, 2015:I have completed my Sonos setup. I am using 5 Sonos Connect:Amp units and 2 Sonos Connect units with an external 12 channel Niles amplifier:Our home has several open areas where I combine two sets of speakers on one Sonos Connect:Amp unit, and that works fine because my speakers are 8 ohms and the Connect:Amp will work fine with 4 ohms. It did not make sense, for example, to have a separate Connect:Amp in our kitchen and family room, which are a larger open area, because you could not be listening to one song or program in one room and another program in the other room since they were open to each other.And I find the Connect:Amp has plenty of power to drive this arrangement.But I had two areas where I wanted three sets of speakers connected to one Sonos unit, so I am using two Sonos Connect units, each of which feed three stereo channels on a 12 channel Niles power amplifier:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CV01QG4?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00The">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CV01QG4?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00The</a> niles amp has individual volume controls for each of its 12 channels, so I am able to fine tune the volume from each speaker.Here is my setup (see photo)Connect #1 - through 3 stereo channels of Niles Amp for two sets of speakers around pool and a set of stereo speakers in our &ldquo;outdoor entertainment deck&rdquo;Connect:Amp #1 - guest bedroomConnect:Amp #2 - second guest bedroom (my wife uses this room for her office)Connect:Amp #3 - drives two sets of speakers in kitchen and family room (which is really just one open area)Connect #2 - through 3 stereo channels of Niles Amp for speakers in living room, foyer, and dining room (of which all these rooms are open to each other)Connect:Amp #4 - drives two sets of speakers in master bed room and master bath roomConnect:Amp #5 - my home officeI hope this helps you visualize how you could use Connect and Connect:Amp in a whole home audio setting. From the reviews it appears a lot of people are doing just that.Update February 12, 2016:In order to more effectively control my Sonos system, I have installed 6 wall mounted iPad Minis around the house. I am using the Vidabox wall mount:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XJKF7R4?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00My">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XJKF7R4?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00My</a> previous whole house audio system used a proprietary control and was connected by cat 5 cables from the control back to the &ldquo;rack room&rdquo; where the audio equipment was located, so I was able to re-purpose those cat 5 cables to power the iPads via a POE (power over ethernet) to USB box, also made by VidaMount:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QSMOO10?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00I">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QSMOO10?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00I</a> also use these iPads to control other systems around the house, such as thermostats, my pool and spa, and even my player piano.</p>

<p>Ordered 6 of these. Couldn&rsquo;t be happier. Increased the value of our home with a modern speaker switching setup. Instead of a $300 speaker switcher we know have $3000 speaker switch setup, yes very expensive choice. but there&rsquo;s nothing else on the market that gives you this option. 1) Play separate music on each speaker. CHECK. 2) Play the same music on each speaker. CHECK. 3) Control the music from your iPhone. iPad. Android. CHECK. 4) Works with Pandora, Spotify, Beats, Radio, Existing Music Library. CHECK. 5) Works with existing in-wall wired speakers. CHECK. Wow what value. Amazing. Nothing else comes close. Too bad Apple bought Beats and not Sonos, but who knows maybe another merger is in the works. Sonos is how I start my day and Sonos is how i finish my day. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier. I love Music and so does Sonos. We own Play 1, Play 2, Play 3, Subwoofer, PlayBar, Bridge, Connect, Connect:Amp x 6, each is an amazing product. We&rsquo;re proud to support Sonos.</p>

<p>Holy cow. This thing rocks. I previously had a mid-level Onkyo surround receiver and matched Polk tower speakers, surrounds, center-channel, sub, etc. It was the hub of my entertainment system as everything went through that. That was a very good system but my wife hated all of the large equipment consuming the living room as well as having to push different combinations of input/output buttons/options in order to switch between sources. For whatever reason, I could never get one remote to work with all the systems so there was a fun process to change from watching TV (from satellite) to watching Amazon Prime from the TV or a BluRay &ndash; i.e. turn off power on white remote, hit HDMI 2 on black remote #1, hit power on black remote #2, etc, etc.I built a new house and the wife insisted that I lose the clutter in the living room. In walks Sonos with a great solution. I paired this with a Playbar, Sub and some non-Sonos built-in surrounds in the ceiling. There is virtually no-hardware consuming my living room, no wires to trip over and it sounds incredible. I did not hardwire any speakers, other than the ceiling surrounds and even that is unnecessary if you purchase Sonos surround speakers. However, you do have the option to hardwire up to 2 speakers with the Amp, if you choose.From a setup standpoint, the only thing that gave me a headache is setting up the AMP after I had the Playbar installed and having them in the same room. However, a quick search of &lsquo;Set up a Sonos CONNECT:AMP with Surround Rears&rsquo; on the Sonos support site pointed me to instructions on how to do this.Technical Section: For those interested, you can&rsquo;t do it from the controller app. You have to sign into a PC/Laptop and go to the configuration page on your network (<a href="http://playbarIP:1400/wiredsat.htm">http://playbarIP:1400/wiredsat.htm</a>), entering your Playbar IP. From there, it&rsquo;s choosing the room from drop-down. Very easy, once you know what to do.Even better, this is all controlled via the family smart-phones. We each have the app downloaded and can easily choose what we want to listen to, control the volume, etc. About the only downside is that we can each control what we want to listen to, control the volume, etc. Occasionally get into a war of control. If I would recommend one software update to Sonos, it would be to allow configuration of one of the controllers to &lsquo;be the master&rsquo; and provide the ability to temporary lock out the others. This would ensure peace in my household or at least I would be happy (as I would control the master :)).One other note that might be helpful for some. I thought I had to hardwire the Sonos Sub, via coax cable, to the Connect Amp. Turns out, the Sub doesn&rsquo;t even have a coax &lsquo;out&rsquo; port. Just a power cord and a network connection, so no need to worry about that. The Amp does have a &lsquo;subwoofer in&rsquo; port but I&rsquo;m guessing this is for a non-Sonos sub.I bought a second one to create a separate zone on my patio outdoors (obviously, the Amp will remain indoors). Will be doing this shortly and will update if I learn anything new but I think this is where the true power of this solution comes in &ndash; i.e. having different zones setup.</p>

<p>I have several of these in our house and have them connected to wired speakers. Currently they are connected to my home network wirelessly but I&rsquo;m thinking about hard wiring them back to my router. I really like Sonos and this equipment has worked flawlessly. A feature I wish Sonos would add is &lsquo;switching&rsquo; capability to the unit. You can control 4 speakers with one Connect:AMP. If there was a &lsquo;switch&rsquo; on this unit you could have many speakers in different rooms for example and use the switch to power up to 4 speakers at a time but these 4 speakers could be in any room of the house. So I could have 4 speakers upstairs operating in the morning but switch it to the downstairs 4 speakers during the afternoon. The alternative is to buy multiple Connect: Amps which at $499 is a bit steep. But I love these units</p>
