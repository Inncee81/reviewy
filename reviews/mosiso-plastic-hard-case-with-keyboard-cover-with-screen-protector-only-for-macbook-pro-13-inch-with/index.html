<h5 id="would-buy-again">Would buy again!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My case got here really fast and it was great! The finish is matte and not glossy at all which was what I wanted. The Apple logo can&rsquo;t be seen unless the computer is on. I would definitely purchase this again! Oh, and it fits like a glove. As for the screen protector I wasn&rsquo;t a big fan because of the reflection but I really didn&rsquo;t really care for it at all when ordering. (MacBook with Retina)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case is absolutely perfect for me. The color was exactly as advertised (mint green) and it fits my laptop like a glove. Oil stains do show up fairly easily, but they disappear when you wipe it down. The film on the white stops at the bottom are peeling a little, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a problem, as this happens with every case I&rsquo;ve had.I really love the keyboard cover as well. It doesn&rsquo;t obstruct my typing like other brands have and it keeps my keys nice and clean. I would definitely recommend choosing this case!</p>

<h5 id="first-impressions-of-a-keen-critic-one-of-satisfaction">First Impressions Of A Keen Critic&ndash;One Of Satisfaction!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered my Mosiso Plastic Hard Case in Wine Red on Sunday June 25th, and it was delivered on Saturday July 1st. I&rsquo;d just picked this item up today July 3rd, so I&rsquo;ve only had it for a few hours now. At first glance, the case appeared to be a plastic cheap looking object wrapped in a simple plastic film, within blue and clear plastic packaging. I inspected the object before opening it for scratches or cracks, seeing as the vessel it came in was so simple&ndash;I&rsquo;d expected a defected item. I immediately tore through the unsightly plastic in a hurry, as I was curious to see if my product would some how start to look like my expectation of it&ndash;and yes, yes it did!The case is a smooth, matte finish and the color is just as it appears online&ndash;with a tinge more dusty brick to it, not as much of a dark-magenta-cranberry hue (if your eyes see anything like mine!). Although I&rsquo;m in love with the matte aspect of the casing, and the color is beautiful, I do wish I could see the Apple symbol through the case (outside of the dim orange-looking symbol that appears when lit)&ndash;but that&rsquo;s just asking for too much at this point, it&rsquo;s a MATTE case for crying out loud! This is a total steal if you ask me. For $14 you get a clean, perfectly fitting case, a matching keyboard cover, and a SCREEN PROTECTOR. I&rsquo;ve had my Macbook Pro 13 for two and a half years and this is the first screen protector I&rsquo;ve had! And it looks great! I&rsquo;ve also always had a problem with getting my keys dirty&ndash;so the keyboard cover is a VERY welcome addition as well (I attempted to clean off my keyboard before putting on the new accessories so you may notice some water spots in the attached photos). Although some of the key lettering isn&rsquo;t PERFECTLY aligned, the fit works out great&ndash;and I&rsquo;m getting used to the new feel of typing with it. No complaints here&ndash;I&rsquo;m just a tough critic!For the price, the accessories, and initial product quality&ndash;I give this product an A+. I look forward to spending more time with this product to see how durable it is, as that is the most important aspect of buying a case for your laptop (aside from the pretty colors, of course). I&rsquo;ve had a Speck case for the last two years, the bottom cracked a year in, I&rsquo;d mysteriously lost one of the little foot buttons, and it collected a lot of dirt within the casing&ndash;that was a $50 product. I hope to get at least a few good miles out of this one. For now, my first impressions are that of a very satisfied customer, and I&rsquo;d definitely buy again just to build up a collection of attractive cases.</p>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This computer case is great! It is inexpensive and high quality. I&rsquo;ve purchased a few over the years and am thoroughly impressed. The only recommendation I would have is to order a color with a keyboard cover that is not clear; my clear one fits perfectly but it shows oil from my fingers very easily. This makes the keyboard look dirty, even after washing the cover and washing my hands before using it (pictures attached).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-case">Solid case!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this because my old case had started to break in places on the bottom piece. I purchased the clear one because I wanted to showcase my laptops natural look but also keep it protected. The crystal clear one is not matte, and it looks almost as if it had nothing on it. It fits my MacBook Pro perfectly. One thing I LOVE is that it comes with an extra set of the rubber feet. That&rsquo;s usually the first thing that breaks off of cases like these. I was not planning on using the keyboard cover or screen protector but decided to give them a try. The screen protector leaves the occasional small bubble, but it&rsquo;s not something I notice at all when I&rsquo;m using the computer. The keyboard cover does make it a bit harder to type, but I don&rsquo;t mind it for light use; if I had to type a lot I would probably take it off. All in all, this is a great purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-was-looking-for">Exactly what I was looking for!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased rose gold. Shiny, sturdy case that snaps right on, it adds <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>-inch bulk and comes with rubber feet to attach to the bottom four corners. I tried to put on the screen protector - it came bent, but seemed perfectly usable anyway. I couldn&rsquo;t get all the bubbles out after 3-4 tries and I was in a hurry so I tossed it since I wanted the case more than the screen protector anyway. The keyboard cover is the best cover I&rsquo;ve used, but it&rsquo;s still a keyboard cover, so it will slow your typing down. It seems better than my last one ever was but I expect it will loosen up as time goes on. I&rsquo;m never a fan of these keyboard covers but I guess it&rsquo;s worth it to protect from water, dust, and cat hair, so I might as well get a color I like! Overall, I love the case, I&rsquo;m happy that it came with rubber feet, and I&rsquo;m actually okay with the keyboard cover.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="1-issue">1 issue</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the color and the finish of it but it doesn&rsquo;t snap on completely. Yes it&rsquo;s the right size. The top part fits perfect but the bottom won&rsquo;t securely stay on. It doesn&rsquo;t just fall off on its own but if you pick it up right it will pop off on one side. If it didn&rsquo;t pop off it would be 5 stars. Maybe I just got a dud.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-color-is-beautiful-it-fitted-well">The color is beautiful, it fitted well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The color is beautiful, it fitted well. However, too poor quality! The corners of the case were too sharp, and it hurts your hand while typing. Eventually, the corners got chipped and got broken out of nowhere. It did not even hit something. I only have it for one month and 10 days! I would invest in something more expensive so it last longer.</p>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t fit a 13 inch 2017 Macbook Pro.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-i-needed">Just what I needed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case fits nice and snug, easy to clip on, and very slim. The apple logo does shine through the case, but it is very dim compared to what you would normally see.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-color-was-what-i-expected-the-price-was">The color was what I expected. The price was &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The color was what I expected. The price was right. No issues with any of the items that came with this set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="in-love">IN LOVE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got here today and I&rsquo;m absolutely in love. I must admit, I only got the maroon as it&rsquo;s my school color and I didn&rsquo;t really pay attention to anything else.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-product-is-not-good-don-t-buy-it">This product is not good, don&rsquo;t buy it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This keyboard cover doesn&rsquo;t work at all. It is to big for my MacBook Pro 13 inch. The top and bottom are separated so I don&rsquo;t understand how it&rsquo;s work and there is no apple mark&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed-due-to-design-and-manufacturing-flaws">Disappointed due to design and manufacturing flaws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case fits snugly and looks nice, but I had to return it because the lip along the front edge of the bottom of the case comes up too far and scrapes at your wrists.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-case">Love the case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the case! Only comments I have for it is that they did not do a good job smoothing down the edges where the case came from the big piece of plastic.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good I love it</p>
