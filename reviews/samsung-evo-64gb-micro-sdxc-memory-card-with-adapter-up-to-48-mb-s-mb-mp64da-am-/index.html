<h5 id="does-amazon-themselves-now-carry-bootlegs">Does Amazon themselves now carry bootlegs??</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered my first card (from Amazon LLC themselves, not marketplace); came with no adapter; eh, no biggy. Packaging coloring was a bit faded, and the back of the packaging was in Chinese first, then English. Huh.Then when I tried to move files into it, it wouldn&rsquo;t take anything more than about 10GB. Photos would be randomly corrupted, and entire folder contents mysteriously vanishing/being deleted (but the folder itself still intact). Also had extremely slow performance; reformatting took 6+ hours!These are signs of a bootleg card.Asked for a replacement, and when I got it, wow the packaging was different.The replacement had:Front:-Came with an actual adapter-The printing is more vibrant, and the big picture in the middle is a thicker sticker than the first card.-The picture is a tablet, versus a phone on the first card.Back:-Correctly labeled as MicroSD XC for a 64GB card on the top right of the back, not MicroSD HC on first card.-&ldquo;Ideal choice for premium smartphones and tablets&rdquo;.-English durability text.-English-first product description text; no Chinese at all.-10 year warranty instead of 5.-Recycling/disposal symbols arranged differently.-The card is MADE IN KOREA.-The barcode has more information.Wow get your stuff together Amazon, what the heck?? How did this get in your supply??I really don&rsquo;t want to start buying electronics from big box retailers for guaranteed genuine items but this is actually the THIRD time in a row I&rsquo;ve gotten a bad card from Amazon (it was a Sandisk before this one), and I&rsquo;m suspecting the one before was a fake now too since it exhibited the exact same symptoms.Hope this helps anyone out there and took look out of you get these.</p>

<h5 id="multiple-units-on-multiple-phones-failed-after-less-than-12-months">Multiple units on multiple phones failed after less than 12 months.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Multiple units on multiple phones failed after less than 12 months.First unit was installed on a Samsung Galaxy S4 &ndash; had to use a file recovery tool after this card corrupted. Never could discover whether it was the Android OS that corrupted it, or a faulty card.Second unit was installed on a Samsung Galaxy S7 &ndash; had to use a file recovery tool after this card corrupted. Never could discover whether it was the Android OS that corrupted it, or a faulty card. This was about 18mo after the first instance&hellip; &hellip;which made me fear the inevitable next&hellip;Third was within a week of the 2nd on my wife&rsquo;s Samsung Galaxy S7. (Just repeat everything about the 3rd-party recovery tool, etc&hellip; You get the point.)At this point, I&rsquo;m simply never going to buy another microSD card, and never use this feature on the Android OS again. I don&rsquo;t trust the cards, nor the Android OS, nor the phones themselves with my data &ndash; and certainly not my photos. The phones were/are all protected and greatly cared for &ndash; only one of the phones was ever &ldquo;dropped hard&rdquo;, and that was inside an Otterbox. We never unmount/remount/remove &ndash; none of that. It&rsquo;s either simply bad code or bad HW, and I&rsquo;m done trying to figure out which.</p>

<h5 id="i-recommend-buying-one-for-your-phone">I recommend buying one for your phone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For anyone who has never used a micro sd card before, whether you get this one or another, I recommend buying one for your phone, tablet, camera, etc to more easily and economically expand the device&rsquo;s memory. There super convenient in exchanging that memory between devices as well. Regular SD cards are less expensive but don&rsquo;t fit all devices (some, like most phones and go pros, require micro sd) whereas you can always put the micro sd into a regular sd adapter to put into those that use a regular sd.On to the review for this particular micro sd&hellip;I got this one because it has relatively quick transfer speeds compared to some of its counterparts in the same price range. I got the 64GB as a mid-range because I couldn&rsquo;t find any good deals on larger memory ones. Plugging this into my wife&rsquo;s phone was easy, and the transfer between the sd and the phone&rsquo;s system memory is completely unnoticeable. Great product for a good price.</p>

<h5 id="gets-the-job-done">Gets the job done</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed more storage space on my phone so I bought this Samsung EVO 64GB Micro SDXC Memory Card with Adapter up to 48/MB/s (MB-MP64DA/AM) to transfer my pictures onto. It worked great. I now have all my pictures safely saved in one place. I don&rsquo;t know if it holds true to 64 GB of storage, honestly I don&rsquo;t even know how to check. Definitely recommend this micro SD card.&lt;&gt; My reviews are based on my experience of the product during receiving the item, using it, and maintaining it. If you have any questions regarding this product that I have not answered please feel free to comment and I will respond as soon as possible. I hope you have found my review to be helpful in your decision to purchase/not purchase this product&hellip;Happy shopping!&hellip;Thank you &lt;&gt;</p>

<h5 id="not-fake">NOT FAKE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When purchased directly from Amazon and not some company selling on Amazon, this product is legitimate and NOT counterfeit.Due to repeated purchases online (some of these products from Amazon selling and distributing products for others) which were fakes, with very low capacities, less than 7Gb in one instance, I now test every memory card I purchase, regardless of where my purchase comes from.This one tested without errors at 61051Mb, which is just fine. I highly recommend this product, especially at the current price.PURCHASED 2ND 64GB SAMSUNG EVO CARD&hellip;I tested this additional card as well and it too was adequate, receiving passing marks. I suggest buying only from retailers or well-recognized online sellers like Amazon, since so many are counterfeit. When you find a seller that sells good memory, stick with them.</p>
