<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-so-far">Great so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First, let me note that most of the reviews are for the Pearl White model, but I bought the Black model. It&rsquo;s slightly different in that it has 5 settings vs. 3 and there&rsquo;s no charger cradle for it. However, it appears everything else is the same. It even can use the Pearl White replacement heads, which I wasn&rsquo;t sure of since the replacement heads state that it&rsquo;s only for the Pearl White model (in point of fact I couldn&rsquo;t find the black model replacement heads on Amazon, which is why I explored this option).If you haven&rsquo;t used an electric toothbrush before, I think it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that the rapid vibrations of the brush head will make the things it comes in contact with tingle, like a small ticklish feeling. Aside from that, the brush worked great the first time I used it, my teeth feeling the freshest they ever have! The brush automatically pauses for 1 second after every 30 second increment and then auto-turns off after 2 minutes. I guess the idea is that 30 seconds should be spent per quadrant of your mouth for a 2 minute total brush time, which is a very clever built-in feature. Other things that encouraged me to buy this brush is that it is purported by the manual and other reviewers that a single charge lasts 1+ month. Also, the brush is waterproof too which means I can use it in the shower. Another thing, there&rsquo;s a brush cover that comes with it, good for a travel bag or the germaphobe. And let me say you cannot beat the price!I got this brush in order to fix my &ldquo;hard brushing&rdquo; habit, which I&rsquo;ve developed after countless bad dental visits. This habit, as I&rsquo;ve been told by every hygienist I talk to, is causing my gums to recede. After one use, I already think that this will solve that issue, because all I have to do is rest the brush on an area of my teeth and move it around to other areas as needed. The vibrations do all the work which means I don&rsquo;t need to apply any pressure at all.In summary, I bought this brush to solve a hard brushing habit that&rsquo;s gone on too long. It&rsquo;s the single biggest improvement that I can do for my dental health at this point, and already I&rsquo;m glad I took the first step.</p>

<h5 id="i-highly-recommend-this-toothbrush">I highly recommend this toothbrush!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an amazing toothbrush! My husband has had two different Phillips Sonicare brushes and two different Oral-B toothbrushes and he was very unhappy with them. He felt the brushes themselves were too small and none of them vibrated fast like he wanted them to. For the low price I thought I would give this one a try. He loves this toothbrush! It has a larger size brush, comes with a massaging pic and he says it does a great job. It doesn&rsquo;t require a base and a cord that sits on the sink counter. This comes with a USB cord and charger. You charge it once a month. If we travel, he can conveniently take it along. I highly recommend this Electric Toothbrush! Give it a try. You&rsquo;ll be happy you did.</p>

<h5 id="very-good-toothbrush">Very good toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this for almost two months now. I liked just about everything about this tooth brush. The five setting are great for switching back and forth when you feel you need it. In my opinion it is very powerful compared to my old electric tooth brush. It took some getting used to and I had to focus on not pushing so hard and basically just setting the brush head lightly against me teeth/gums. Once I got that down it was great! The timer is also very nice so you make sure you brush all over equally. The battery also works just as advertised. I charged this the night I got it and went a full 30 days before I had to charge it. There was very minimal if any change in the power of the brush from the day I charged it to the next time I charged it. My last favorite part of this toothbrush was the cost can quality. I am completely satisfied with it.The only Thing I would&rsquo;ve liked to see is that it would have came with a charger. That was advertised it didn&rsquo;t but I think it would be nice if it had one. Then again who doesn&rsquo;t have an extra USB charger lying around these days?</p>

<h5 id="honestly-the-best-toothbrush-i-ve-purchased-in-a-long-time">Honestly the BEST toothbrush I&rsquo;ve purchased in a long time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly the BEST toothbrush I&rsquo;ve purchased in a long time! I&rsquo;m so happy with this purchase! I ended up buys two, one for me and one for my husband. We each love it as it holds a charge for a month or longer! I&rsquo;ve honestly only charged it once since I recieved it and I&rsquo;ve had it for 6 weeks &amp; brush my teeth a minimum of twice a day&hellip;I love that it comes with THREE brush heads and they sent a cute an interdental brush with it as well which is incredible&hellip; I will be buying this set every single time I need a new one!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="teeth-feel-clean-14-hours-later">Teeth feel clean 14 hours later</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading reviews and the price wasn&rsquo;t bad either I decided to take the plunge and buy a new toothbrush. I had at one point a $150 sonicare but it died a few years ago and I couldn&rsquo;t get myself to fork over that amount again, so I&rsquo;ve been using a low grade spinbrush. It got the job done or so I thought, but after awhile I felt like my teeth weren&rsquo;t clean even after scrubbing for several minutes. I brushed, flossed and even bought a little dental tool kit to help with plaque but nothing was working. I&rsquo;ve had it less than week and my teeth feel like I they do right after a dental visit, without the soreness, and all day long. They also included a interdental brush to try and that is the best thing ever! I don&rsquo;t know how I went so long without discovering a brush like that. For the price and effectiveness, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a clean mouth and more money in their pocket.</p>

<h5 id="all-5-modes-seem-great-for-having-the-pearly-whites-of-your-dreams-without">All 5 modes seem great for having the pearly whites of your dreams without &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Toothbrush is surprisingly light and quite powerful. I&rsquo;m not a fancy person so I&rsquo;m a bit confused why someone would massage their teeth. All 5 modes seem great for having the pearly whites of your dreams without being the same cost of actual pearls. My box came with a VIP invitation for future discount fairywill products. The toothbrush seems very nice, but the website has typos and seems a bit weird. 5 stars, everything I wanted from an electric toothbrush and so much lighter and more powerful than any I&rsquo;ve owned before.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-electric-toothbrush-and-very-good-price">Great electric toothbrush and very good price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was initially sceptical because of the price and almost opted for the Oral B electric toothbrushes at twice the price. Glad I stuck with these. They&rsquo;re working great so far and love the timer feature it has. My teeth feel cleaner after using this and I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now. It came with 3 brush heads total and a bonus brush head to clean in between teeth.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this toothbrush, it was a great buy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="light-weight-great-for-everyday-and-travel">Light weight, great for everyday and travel</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d say that this toothbrush offers good value for dollar. It&rsquo;s very light weight and seems to do a good job cleaning my teeth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-a-little-weak-though">Great! A little weak though.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great toothbrush and I love all of the different settings it has. I think the only downside is it seems a tad bit weak. I usually do 4 minutes instead of the set 2 minutes.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<p>The kids love them</p>

<h5 id="great-electric-toothbrush-for-the-price">Great electric toothbrush for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great toothbrush - with excellent features for the price. Better than many more expensive models I&rsquo;ve owned.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-toothbrush">A great toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it, works great. As good or better than brushes that cost $100 more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-good-electric-brush-for-less-than-25">A good electric brush for less than $25</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was on the edge about buying this. A good electric brush for less than $25?! No way! But after reading the reviews I figured it was worth the risk, and I join the long list of&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Husband needed this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-clean-takes-a-little-getting-used-to">Super clean, takes a little getting used to.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At first, the way that this vibrates had me disappointed, because the head doesn&rsquo;t really move-in rather that entire half of the brush just vibrates.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="totally-recommend">Totally Recommend!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I liked this toothbrush so much that I later bought one for my husband! I received the white model while his came in black.</p>
