<p>Worked great charging my travel trailer batteries while dry camping! You need to order the MC4 male female connectors, 2 crimp on battery connectors, and some extra solar panel wire to make it work for you. FYI&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This item total l&rsquo;y me et my expectation , it d√©livers a power very close to the 100 watts announcedIt is light , flexible , very tough, it resist rain , salt water, dust , achesIt uses a MC4 connector that is weather resistantIt made my RV totally autonomous on a 2 weeks period, no more starting the generator to keep the battery alive!!!We are very satisfy and we will buy more of this panel!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-i-needed">Just what I needed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just what I needed. Don&rsquo;t use the RV generator much, hate the noise, smell and pollution. Bought 2 of the flexible 50W solar panels to make a portable 100W solar battery charger for my small RV. Have the panels hinged together so I can fold over on each other for storage. Whole system with controller and 22&rsquo; of wire weights 11 pounds and fits in a soft-sided portfolio bag. On a bright sunny day here in SoCal measured 18.8V, 6.33A for 119W. On an overcast day depending on position and of the sun it generated 30-60W. Nice! Keeps my batteries topped off without use of the generator.Only used a few times, but so far so good. Got a lot of interest from other RV owners. Hopefully more folks will make their own and stop running their generators all the time.Only negative for these panels is that the clear plastic sheeting over the panels is flimsy,was poorly applied, lots of air bubbles. Looks like it should be removed, peeled off. Also the panel wire junction is on the front of the panel (solar cell side), for my arrangement it would be nicer if they were on the back side.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-portable-applications">Great for portable applications</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have this hooked to a portable home made &ldquo;solar generator&rdquo;. Very efficient panel, particularly on overcast days.Admittedly, I have not yet used this panel during the short winter days; but thus far in the summer months of June and July, I have found it to be a worthwhile investment. (I am at 39-degrees latitude).The light weight is certainly a plus for my application. Depending on the sun angle, I can just throw it down on the ground, or put it on an angle-adjustable PVC frame I made by utilizing the panel&rsquo;s corner grommets and some wire ties. It has spent the last several weeks on the roof of my porch. The pitch of the roof is pretty optimal for this time of year, and I can put it in place and retrieve it via a nearby window. Again, the light weight and reduced fragility of this panel is a huge plus for moving it around, and transporting it.One note that should be obvious, but I will state it anyway: Be advised that &ldquo;bendable&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;fold-able&rdquo;. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about keeping it perfectly flat, but the flexibility does have its limits.</p>

<h5 id="this-panel-is-lightweight-and-packable-which-is-perfect-for-my-portable-gens-and-for-rv-applications">This panel is lightweight and packable which is perfect for my portable gens and for RV applications</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve purchased several flexible panels over the past year to build portable solar generators, and add extra power to an RV, build small &lsquo;charging stations&rsquo; for lights and phones/tablets, etc. This panel exceeds what I expected, and even what the manufacturer had listed. On a windy day in Jan., I&rsquo;ve seen 4.0 amps on my charge controller for input current with this panel. Yes, 4.0 amps from a 50 watt rated panel!I also have a couple of 100 watt panels that are very efficient from another brand, but not quite up to this level of efficiency. This panel is lightweight and packable which is perfect for my portable gens and for RV applications. The 100 watt panels are super nice for extra juice but this 50 watt panel charges up my 100 amp battery generator easily. I would have never believed it without seeing it. Highly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-bendable-panel">Very Nice Bendable Panel</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this solar panel a couple of weeks ago to mount on my teardrop trailer. I wanted to be able to go off the grid while traveling and it has worked out great. I used VHB industrial strength tape to attach it to the roof of my trailer. It took me a while to get all of the components to run the wiring from the panel, under the trailer, into the galley, to the controller, and to the batteries. So far it has worked fine- I have two 12 volt batteries in the galley so if I want I can go weeks with out Connecting to shore power. I am using quick release connectors from the controller to the batteries so I can switch form the fresh battery to the used battery. The panel is so light weight and lays flat on the roof. It definitely is better than the 3X2 solid panels I was originally going to use. I may eventually buy a second Bendable panel to lay next to this one.</p>

<h5 id="great-solar-panels-for-rv-motorhome-roofs">Great Solar Panels for RV/Motorhome roofs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So we have a small RV only 21 feet. Put 4 of these on our rooftop in parallel. These solar panels are ideal to that purpose, since they are somethat flexible and can conform to the shape of the RV Roof. They were very easy to install. Our panels put out 19.4V each and Watts depend on how sunny it is. Shipping was very fast. The packaging is good. They come covered with a plastic cover adhered to top that needs to be removed and a nice soft styrofoam sheet protecting the panel during shipping. The wire connectors are on top at the long end side. We only installed these about 2 weeks ago, so have no long term review of the performance yet, but so far they are great. Installation is easy. Grommet holes on the edges of the panel permit installation with screws and washers without blocking any of the solar tiles. Since we put them on an RV we also used highly adhesive tape on the underside edges of the panel and putty tape under the grommet holes to prevent roof leaks. We encased all the edges with Dicor lap sealant to prevent air catching under and lifting away. Overall very happy with these panels . Will post update in a few months to see how they are holding up.</p>
