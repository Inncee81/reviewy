</ul>

<p>Diamond-Shaped Bristles Remove More Plaque With 44 percent more bristles than ProResults Standard, DiamondClean toothbrush heads remove more plaque deep between teeth and along the gum line to decrease your risk of gingivitis. The diamond shaped bristles of the brush head gently clean and whiten teeth by removing surface stains and buildup. The DiamondClean brush heads remove up to 5x more plaque than a manual toothbrush. Replace Every Three Months You can&rsquo;t see it, but your brush head wears over time. Blue reminder bristles fade in color to let you know when it&rsquo;s time to replace the brush head. Dental professionals recommend replacing your brush head every three months. Sonicare technology helps you remove up to two times more plaque compared to a manual toothbrush. The DiamondClean Standard brush head works with the following Sonicare models: DiamondClean, FlexCare+, FlexCare, HealthyWhite, and EasyClean. The heads easily snap onto handles and come with caps for hygienic storage and travel.</p>

<h5 id="pretty-sure-these-are-fake-and-definitely-sure-they-last-2-weeks-and-are-extremely-noisy">Pretty sure these are FAKE and definitely sure they last 2 weeks and are EXTREMELY noisy!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a strong feeling these are fake/imitation/knockoffs!!! Not only do these make a VERY loud vibrating noise as if they were not molded right and defective, which is what began my concerns, they also need to be replaced in about 2 weeks!!! I&rsquo;d rather buy from a real store for a higher price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have purchased HX6066/70 DiamondClean 6 pack last year(2014) from a different seller on Amazon. It came with the whole box. Each toothbrush has &ldquo;DiamondClean&rdquo; print on it.But this new 6 pack I just purchased have &ldquo;Philips Sonicare&rsquo; instead of &ldquo;DiamondClean&rdquo; print. I took one out and tried it. The brush bristles are much harder than the ones I purchased last year. It hurts my gum. Also the quality is not as good as either. Under the bottom of the snap-on, the metal has changed color from exposure to the air and the white plastic part is not smooth. I&rsquo;m very disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="the-toothbrushes-themselves-seem-fine-but-i-don-t-like-the-fact-that-the-packaging">The toothbrushes themselves seem fine but I don&rsquo;t like the fact that the packaging &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The toothbrushes themselves seem fine but I don&rsquo;t like the fact that the packaging arrived opened. Photos attached. Feels like I may have bought counterfeit items.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-for-a-known-great-product">Great value for a known great product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel very little needs to be said about Phillips Sonicare DiamondClean brush heads as it is well known that the product is top-notch and recommended by dentists nearly everywhere. We&rsquo;ve used this exact brush head twice a day for over a year and have received nothing but praise/compliments from the dentist.As for the value of this purchase, it definitely needs to be reviewed. At $54/pack ($9/brush head) with Prime shipping, this purchase is a no-brainer. Neither Costco, Sams, or BJs could come anywhere close to this price. Even with coupons at BJs, the price still remained nearly $10.50/brush head.My closing opinion is this simple, as long as the cost stays under $10.50/brush head with Prime shipping, Amazon is the way to go for this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-was-perfect-as-there-are-three-of-us">This was perfect as there are three of us</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had previously purchased one of these 6 packs in the past. Each brush has a symbol on it and in my previous purchase, there were three symbols, two brushes with each. This was perfect as there are three of us. When I purchased this product, I looked at the pictures and zoomed it to see three symbols. When my package arrived, I was quite disappointed that I had two different symbols, three brushes with each. The product I am very pleases with in all other respects, but I was mis-lead by the picture which is the reason for only three stars. I have attached two pictures. The packaged one shows that I was send only two different symbols. The other shows three symbols and was a screen capture from one of the pictures I checked on the product page before I ordered.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="although-it-looks-just-like-the-diamondclean">Although it looks just like the DiamondClean</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although it looks just like the DiamondClean, it&rsquo;s not the same. I see reviews saying these are authentic and it maybe but to me they just don&rsquo;t work the same as the ones I buy directly from SC (2 pack). For one, the ones I buy directly actually says &ldquo;DiamondClean&rdquo; on the brush head and these just say &ldquo;Philips Sonicare&rdquo;. It does fit on my DC toothbrush but makes a loud noise while I&rsquo;m cleaning that&rsquo;s so annoying - it sounds like it&rsquo;s not fitted tightly but it is. The bristles also do not feel the same as the originals - it feels softer. Some may like that but I don&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t be buying these again. I get mine at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and even though it costs more, there&rsquo;s a reason and worth paying more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="use-the-real-thing-for-best-results">Use The Real Thing For Best Results!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well - Let me qualify that &ldquo;Love It&rdquo; just a tad. They cost too much!BUT, they are SO much better than the knock-offs that look the same but are not - The ones that are less expensive but with poor quality bristles and cheap &lsquo;o&rsquo; ring washers. You get what you pay for.I love my Waterpik and use it regularly - Top reduce its effectiveness by buying cheap copies of the briush heads is, to my way of thinking, &lsquo;penny-wise and pound-foolish.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="prepare-for-hearing-loss">Prepare for hearing loss</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They work fine as long as you don&rsquo;t mind wearing industrial ear muffs while using them. I would rate the noise of these rattly things as somewhere between a 777 taking off and two cement trucks colliding head-on at highways speed. What&rsquo;s that? Oh sorry I can&rsquo;t hear you since I&rsquo;m deaf now due to these replacement heads. Want your wife to leave you? Try brushing with these at 6 AM. If she&rsquo;s within shooting range she will awaken wondering if maybe a police helicopter has crashed through the roof. What I&rsquo;m trying to say is they are ridiculously loud. If these are fake, shame on Amazon. If they&rsquo;re genuine OEM, shame on Philips.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-hate-buying-them-but-it-s-worth-it-when-you-get-that-new-head-feeling-again">You hate buying them, but it&rsquo;s worth it when you get that new head feeling again</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Getting fleeced by Philips is no fun, but the feeling of a new diamond clean head on your teeth is worth it&hellip;i guess</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="oem-brush-heads-for-sonicare">OEM Brush Heads for Sonicare</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Phillips Diamondcare brush heads in a bulk package (brown box, not retail). These are priced fairly, and are actual Phillips heads instead of some knock-off third party&hellip;</p>
