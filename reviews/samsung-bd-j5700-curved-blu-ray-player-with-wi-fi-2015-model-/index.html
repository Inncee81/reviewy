<h5 id="solid-blu-ray-good-user-experience-dvd-up-scaling-could-be-better">Solid Blu-Ray, Good User Experience, DVD Up-Scaling Could Be Better</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Samsung BD-J5700 is a fine Blu-ray disk player with smart features and a good user interface and it integrates well with Samsung smart TV&rsquo;s. But it has some pitfalls too. I like it with reservations. In this review I&rsquo;ll set my environment so my results can be seen in contextI got the Samsung BD-J5700 because I have a Samsung smart TV and was hoping it would integrate even better than my B00SKXTFWS Panasonic DMP-BDT270 Blu-Ray which I already liked a lot. Unlike the 4K up-scaling Panasonic this Samsung is a 1080P player and does not play 4K content. It is also less expensive&hellip;SHORT VERSIONPro&rsquo;s:+ Integrates well with Samsung Smart TV&rsquo;s+ Easy Setup (wired or wireless)+ Fast Startup+ Logical and responsive user interface+ Well designed remote+ Good App Selection and Home Networking+ Compact SizeCon&rsquo;s:- Upscaling of DVD media could be better- Amazon app appears to be SD onlyBottom line is if DVD up-scaling or Amazon app HD are not really important this is a 5 star value. If they are, then 4 stars.For more details, read on&hellip;SETUP:I set the BD-J5700 up with a physical LAN connection. I had it available and I think it&rsquo;s more reliable than WiFi. I did configure my WiFi settings manually and it connected right away and was able to access YouTube with good quality. I then reverted to my preferred wired LAN.NOTE: Once the player is running I strongly recommend upgrading the firmware in the settings under the support menu item. When I upgraded to firmware 1006.1 the Amazon app appeared. Nice.IN USE:When turning on the Samsung player the time to home screen is about the same as the Panasonic which I feel is very fast. From turn-on to home screen with a Blu-Ray in the tray is about 8 seconds! To display the image of the Blu-ray in the play-disc box is another 3 seconds. Yup. I think that&rsquo;s pretty quick and includes the player using CEC protocol to tell my Samsung TV to switch the active input to the player.The home screen is logically laid out (see picture) with boxes for media (disc plus home networked or USB based photos, videos, music) on the top. Below that are 4 app favorites. Mine default to Hulu Plus, Amazon, You Tube and Netflix. There is the Opera TV store with more web content and a plus with the label more which brings you to the full list of apps. Next there is change device to select the source on your network and access to player settings.The full list of built-in Apps on mine include Amazon, Hulu Plus, You Tube, VUDU, CinemaNow, InternetTV, Yupp TV, Netflix, Pandora, Rhapsody, AccuWeather. I&rsquo;ve only used Amazon, You Tube, Netflix and Pandora. All were fine for me except Amazon. The Amazon app seems unable to stream HD content - all that was available to me was SD. If you are getting in part for the Amazon app, you might want to consider other options like the Fire TV.MEDIA CONSIDERATIONS:In my video library is a lot of DVD content and how they play is important to me. In particular how well a Blu-ray player can up-scale the DVD video for display on HD players. Up-scaling is very difficult to do well and the BD-J5700 does a credible job, but not as well as the more expensive Panasonic player and it&rsquo;s 4K up-scaling hardware. If you have a large DVD library and up-scaling matters to you consider spending a little more money for the Panasonic.As I add new content on physical media I&rsquo;m choosing Blu-ray where possible. Blu-Ray plays fine and has a startup as quick as the Panasonic. On my HD TV there is no visible quality difference. Excellent.REMOTE:The Samsung BD-J5700 remote is needed to do pretty much anything except turn on the power or open the tray. Happily it is well laid with nicely sized buttons for my hands. It can also turn my Samsung TV on/off and change the volume and input. The batteries were included for the remote. The IR LED is bright enough to work pointed almost anywhere in my living room. This remote is better in just about every way than the already good remote that came with the Panasonic.CONCLUSIONS:I like the Samsung BD-J5700 Blu-ray player. Most things are very good and it has a speedy and logically laid out interface and very good remote with a good user experience. But for me there are a couple of shortcomings too. First the Amazon app seems to be SD only (maybe a future firmware update will fix this?), and second dvds do not upscale as well as the Panasonic player at $25 more (as of this review). Not bad, but noticeably worse.If you have a lot of DVD content or Amazon video in HD matters consider the Panasonic. If not this is a good value and has a better user interface. For me this is 4 stars, but if you don&rsquo;t care about the up-scaling it may be 5 stars for you.Hope this helps someone!</p>

<h5 id="netflix-now-works-fine-very-good-bluray-player">NETFLIX now works fine. VERY GOOD BLURAY PLAYER</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After updating firmware to v. 1005 on 4/13/15, Netflix is working fine. Apps include Amazon, but not HBO Go, although maybe future updates will add HBO. Comes with HDMI cable and AAA batteries. USB on front. HDMI, digital audio out, Ethernet on back. Yes, it has WiFi and Ethernet. Picture is great. Plays BluRay, DVD, CD, and audio CDs. Requires remote (included) to operate, but works with Samsung TV remote, so you don&rsquo;t need multiple remotes. Updating firmware takes &lt;2 min online with FiOS <sup>25</sup>&frasl;<sub>25</sub> internet. Detects my wifi network from the other side of the house with chimney in between, so I think it has a good wifi receiver. Does not have a power light, but not a major issue. You will certainly know when it&rsquo;s off because there will be no picture on the screen. Don&rsquo;t read reviews prior to firmware v. 1005 on this machine. It&rsquo;s a very good BD player at a very good price.</p>

<p>I am sorry but after 3 months I am changing my original review. Just as many others, my wireless connection has dropped out. I monitor it on the operator panel of my WiFi device and can see it dropping in and out. I am in the process of upgrading the software that I downloaded from their web page and hope this fixes it. I doubt it. Samsung BD-J5700 Curved Blu-ray Player with Wi-Fi (2015 Model)</p>

<h5 id="happy-with-my-purchase">Happy With My Purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This dvd player worked right out of the box once I got the appropriate connecting cable. I hooked up this smart dvd player to an older projection tv. Once connected I was able to go on the internet, register the device and start streaming. The whole process took about 10 minutes. I am now purchasing a digital cable to a &ldquo;Y&rdquo; splitter to a sound system. I will re-post after I get some sound. So far I am very happy with my purchase.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was a mistake to buy this blu ray player&hellip;at first it kept going to British tv&hellip;it finally updated and quit doing that&hellip;then I had to put the network passcode in every time I tried to use it&hellip;now it won&rsquo;t work at all&hellip;the network settings say I have entered the wrong IP address, which isn&rsquo;t true&hellip;I have not changed any settings and I have had constant trouble with it and now it won&rsquo;t stream any videos. I contacted support and they just wanted me to download the owner&rsquo;s manual, which I already have.</p>

<h5 id="buyer-beware-deserves-zero-stars">Buyer Beware! Deserves ZERO stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If I could give zero stars I would. Purchased at the end of November and now it won&rsquo;t even turn on. The wi-fi capability worked for a good three weeks and then had to be hard-wired in. The disc eject button worked when it felt like it. The power button worked some of the time. Now it is completely useless. BUYER BEWARE!!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="malfunctions-after-a-year">Malfunctions after a year</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this player back in Nov. 2015 and it worked great for about a year. Then for some reason (most likely product defect), the player started shutting down and restarting itself midplay. This would happen whether I was watching a blu-ray or streaming Netflix or Amazon. Needless to say, it was incredibly annoying. I contacted Samsung customer service for a fix, but they were of little help. Rebooting and resetting back to factory defaults did nothing to solve the problem. I searched online for solutions too and learned that many people have run into this problem. Although the message boards offered a variety of possible fixes, most were a bit too technical or tedious for me, so sadly I will probably drop the money to buy another player, although I won&rsquo;t buy another Samsung this time. I DO NOT recommend this player.</p>
