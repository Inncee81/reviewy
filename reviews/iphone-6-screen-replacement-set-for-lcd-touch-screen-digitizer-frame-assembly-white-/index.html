<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="thank-you-great-product">Thank you GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to apologize to Oli &amp; Ode. I incorrectly gave them a bad review of the product I had ordered. I had order another item from another vendor and it was DOA. I was not paying attention and placed the review where it should have not gone. The product I ordered from Oli &amp; Ode fits and works like a charm. I have no complaints at all. Once again I apologize to Oli &amp; Ode</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="keep-shopping">keep shopping</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works&hellip; I mean, I&rsquo;ll give it that. But the pictures isn&rsquo;t as sharp as the original screen and it&rsquo;s not as bright. Unless you count the spots around the outside edge of the screen that are much brighter than the rest of the screen, like light in leaking around the edge of the screen.Yeah.This screen sucks.I&rsquo;d kinda prefer my broken one back. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t thrown it away, it had a clean crack through the middle and I&rsquo;d actually have preferred to just put a glass screen protector over it and just left if alone over having this screen&hellip; I will probably be buying another (different brand) screen and trying again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for">You get what you pay for..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this product because I was having problems with my old screen being unresponsive and the price was okay too being why I only gave it two stars. There are multiple errors with this screen. I took my screen to a professional to get it done. Installer told me the ports on top for the camera are bit smaller than the Apple screen in which was a touch fit and the heat bracket that needs to be screwed back on doesn&rsquo;t completely line up which you have to play with it and at the end wasn&rsquo;t completely lined up. The home button was tricky and my iPhone won&rsquo;t recognize he Touch ID and I tried steps on YouTube to see about fixing it and no luck. Overall I ordered this screen to fix my problem&hellip; it somewhat did but still my screen is being unresponsive and when I touch down on certain areas their are like markings being picked down as before it wasn&rsquo;t like that.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-but-fubar-d-it-make-sure-you-need-6-and-not-6s">Great product, but FUBAR&rsquo;d it. Make sure you need 6 and not 6s!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived quickly and was packaged well. No problems at all with the product until I destroyed it while trying to put it on my <em>6s</em>. Please learn from my expensive FUBAR and triple check to make sure you need the 6 here, not the <em>6s</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-it">WORTH IT!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I will have to say this is really a good replacement screen and I highly recommend people to buy this product. Yes, I did have some problem. The first screen I got from Oli&amp;Ode was disfunctional, so I contacted the costumer service, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe they replied me within just a couple hours and it was 2am (CT) when they did. After they confirmed that the product was not functioning correctly, they sent me a new one, now the new screen works so perfectly. $20 for a almost identical screen and excellent customer service, this deserves a five-star review no doubt.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tools-are-very-useful-as-they-are-magnetic">Tools are very useful as they are magnetic</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;1、Great quality product and quick delivery too would definitely use again if my screen cracks. Tools are very useful as they are magnetic. Well packaged too2、Perfect replacement for OEM screen. Just needed to follow a youtube video and with a little patience it all went together nicely. &ldquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-installation">Easy installation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen protector by Oil &amp; Ode was easy to install to my iPhone 6. First you clean the screen and dry it with the tools included. Make sure to clean it really good. Then you put the tempered glass screen protector on. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to line up. I got mine on without any bubbles. Then your phone screen is protected from breaks and scratches. It&rsquo;s also pretty good about fingerprints. My screen has way less fingerprints with this screen protector than normal. If you need to protect your iPhone 6, I would recommend this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-price-screen-replacement-feels-like-original">Good quality/price screen replacement. Feels like original.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fast shpping, and came in perfect condition.It was really easy to remove the old water-damaged screen, and put this one.No, it does not have the apple logo. Still, it works the same, resolution looks the same, brightness control works as expected, fits like a glove.Hope not to have to buy another one (yeah, gf insist in taking the phone close to the shower) but if i need to this will be my choice yet again..Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-good-screen-replacement-for-iphone">Very GOOD Screen replacement for iPhone.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very GOOD Screen replacement for iPhone, will order again if I need in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had no problems with the installation and was very happy with the quality of the display.It was one of those purchases that makes you happy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quick-and-inexpensive-fix">quick and inexpensive fix</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I made sure to set up a nice clean, well-lit area on the kitchen table and used masking tape to stick the screws on so they wouldn&rsquo;t get lost.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-for-25-dollars">Good quality for 25 dollars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just get my new screen on. Solid quality for 25 dollars, can&rsquo;t compliant. Color quality is kinda light compare to origin screen, but original screen is like 120$ at least so it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Neat product. I have scratched my screen before I bought this and it filled in to the scratches. You can still see the old ones but it hasn&rsquo;t lifted or anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-packaging-and-very-professional">Great packaging and very professional</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Screen came on time. Great packaging and very professional. Installed screen with no problem! Turned on the phone and the the quality of the screen looked amazing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="starsi-m-pretty-satisfied">starsI&rsquo;m pretty satisfied.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this screen yesterday and replaced it with my non-working screen. Instructions are clear, but you want to watch some repair videos first.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-perfectly">Works Perfectly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this to try and replace my iphone screen by myself to save money . First, toss any instructions that come with the kit and find a good you tube video.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">great product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great tutorial - and product however the screw drivers provided would not work on some of the screws. I use my own one. The process was delayed because of the issue . .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stopped-working-after-4-hours">Stopped working after 4 hours</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Screen worked for about 4 hours. Now have to double tap and even then that won&rsquo;t work all the time. Payed for the warranty and it&rsquo;s been a run around since I got it.</p>
