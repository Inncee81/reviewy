<p>Powerful 25x Optical Zoom with Intelligent IS helps optimize image stabilization for virtually shake-free images.</p>

<p>25x Optical Zoom (25–625mm)
With the PowerShot SX620 HS camera in hand, you’ll be impressed at the zooming capabilities of this slim, compact digital camera. The amazing 25x Optical Zoom lens packs high zoom power into a slim design to get you down on the field, high atop a skyscraper, deep into a landscape and much more. The camera’s advanced technology helps ensure that images and videos are captured in outstanding quality, with Intelligent IS that chooses the stabilization method that matches the shooting conditions, so images are virtually shake-free in a wide variety of situations.</p>

<p>Intelligent IS
Intelligent IS analyzes camera movement and applies a suitable shake correction method for the shooting situation. For stills, the system selects from Normal IS, Panning IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Tripod modes. When shooting video, the system selects from Dynamic IS, Powered IS, Macro (Hybrid) IS and Active Tripod IS modes. With Intelligent IS, you can concentrate on image capture, letting the camera make effective IS settings to help capture a steady image.</p>

<p>Still Image Shooting
Normal IS   Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning IS  Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
Video Recording
Dynamic IS  Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered IS  Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Macro (Hybrid) IS   Corrects for motion blur that is likely to occur when shooting video while walking. Also compensates for the shift-type camera shake common in macro shooting.
Active Tripod IS    When shooting video while using a tripod, the image stabilization is active to compensate for slight camera shake.
Built-in Wi-Fi* and NFC** allows for easy sharing and transferring of images and videos.</p>

<p>Built-in Wi-Fi Technology Makes Sharing Quick and Easy
Built-in Wi-Fi technology allows for on-the-go convenience when you want to share your photos and videos with friends and family. Easily post your images to select social networking and media sites – Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, and Google Drive – through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY† directly from your PowerShot SX620 HS camera, or save them to the online photo album to share anytime, anywhere. The camera can also connect directly to both compatible iOS and Android devices<em>, and upload images via the Canon Camera Connect app</em> without a computer. You can control the destination of your uploads to share with everyone or to select groups, and even add comments. Sharing video is also easy with Wi-Fi equipped PowerShot cameras, which record video using the easy-to-share MP4 format. Wi-Fi capability makes posting in real time possible, so you can keep everyone up to date with photos and video even as events unfold. Wi-Fi technology also allows you to transfer images to other Wi-Fi equipped PowerShot cameras or print your photos directly to a PictBridge (Wireless LAN) certified printer. Thanks to the newly added Wi-Fi Button, you can now connect in both Shooting mode and Playback mode for quick and easy operation. You can even turn on the camera and connect at the same time with just one press of the button, helping you get right to sharing and managing your files when you like.</p>

<p>Built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) Technology
PoowerShot digital cameras with built-in NFC (Near Field Communication) technology provide fast connectivity with a single tap. Simply touch the NFC icon on your camera to your compatible Android device*<em>, and the Camera Connect app</em> will launch automatically for quick, easy sharing of your images. Built-in NFC technology also makes it simple to install the app. If the app hasn&rsquo;t been installed yet, once you touch the devices together for the first time, the download screen will display automatically. Simply touch the camera against an NFC-equipped device with the Canon Camera Connect app* installed, and a Wi-Fi connection is established – no camera operations required. Even if your camera is off, NFC turns the camera on and establishes the connection (confirming the camera’s nickname and privacy settings before the first connection is required).</p>

<p>Image Sync Function
In addition to wirelessly transferring photos and videos through CANON iMAGE GATEWAY† to your computer, you can now view and download them from your compatible smartphone.†† Take them where you like, when you like, and use your familiar smartphone operations to view and share them.</p>

<p>Remote Shooting with the Camera Connect App
With the built-in Wi-Fi on the PowerShot SX620 HS camera, you can use your compatible smartphone or tablet* to remotely control the camera. Simply connect wirelessly to your device and access the Canon Camera Connect app*. Your device will show a live image of the camera&rsquo;s capture – ideal for a commemorative group photo, wildlife shots and all kinds of situations. The camera’s versatile 25x Optical Zoom, flash, self-timer and shutter are all under your control, with images being saved to your camera as usual.</p>

<p>20.2 Megapixel*** CMOS sensor with DIGIC 4+ Image Processor helps deliver stunning image quality even in low light.
20.2 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS Sensor
The PowerShot SX620 HS camera employs a 20.2 Megapixel*** High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor, which delivers powerful imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light-capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for high ISO capture with reduced noise. It&rsquo;s also incredibly fast, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, as well as enabling fast continuous shooting and fast autofocus.</p>

<p>*** Image processing may cause a decrease in the number of pixels.</p>

<p>DIGIC 4+ Image Processor
The Canon DIGIC 4+ Image Processor powers the PowerShot SX620 HS camera’s advanced functions and capabilities. Its accelerated processing speed creates fast, responsive performance, for a shooting experience that can be smooth and natural. The DIGIC 4+ Image Processor also helps enhance image quality by shortening the processing of high ISO shots by almost 60% compared to the DIGIC 4 Image Processor. This helps reduce noise for brilliant color, smooth gradations and beautiful detail even in low light.</p>

<p>Capture spectacular 1080p Full HD video.
The PowerShot SX620 HS camera is designed to make beautiful, creative video capture easy and fun. Image quality is luminous and lifelike in 1080p Full HD with a smooth frame rate of up to 30p. MP4 format, ideal for sharing and playing on mobile devices, is also available. Dynamic IS offers image stabilization that can correct strong camera shake that can occur when you shoot while running or walking backward.</p>

<p>Large 3.0-inch LCD (approx. 922,000 dots) allows easy viewing even from a wide angle.
The large, 3.0-inch high-resolution LCD screen makes it easy to both frame and review your shots. A resolution of approximately 922,000 dots helps make even small details clear, and images are viewable even from a wide angle, so showing others what you&rsquo;ve captured is easy, too.</p>

<p>Hybrid Auto lets you record up to four seconds of video before each image you capture, then automatically combines each clip and still into a quick video recap of the day.
Hybrid Auto records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the clips and pictures* into a video that captures the essence of special days: vacations, important occasions or any time you’re shooting many shots in a day. In this mode, Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings for incredibly high image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady, so your “highlight reel” is stunningly beautiful.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pictures can be withheld from the resulting video via menu settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Smart AUTO intelligently selects the proper settings for the camera based on predefined shooting situations to help you create the best possible image.
Smart AUTO
Smart AUTO is a sophisticated Canon technology that makes getting that great shot as simple as pressing the shutter button. It automatically detects scenes by assessing various factors in both the background and the subject. Detected scenes are analyzed using predefined shooting situations*. The camera then makes optimal settings to help facilitate incredible image capture, whether you’re shooting stills or video. With Smart AUTO, all you have to do is frame your shot and capture away.</p>

<ul>
<li>32 predefined shooting situations for still images, and 21 predefined shooting situations for videos.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shooting Modes
PowerShot cameras offer shooting modes that make it easy to take impressive photos in a wide range of shooting situations by providing intelligent presets with optimized settings.</p>

<p>Program Access advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically.
Hybrid Auto Automatically selects shooting settings for optimal quality and records a video clip every time you capture a still image. One day’s worth of clips are then combined into a single video.
Smart AUTO  The camera automatically selects the ideal shooting settings for high quality based on subjects and environmental factors to provide point-and-shoot simplicity.
Creative Shot   Analyzes the scene and applies a number of creative filters to automatically create five variations in addition to the original image.
Portrait    The camera sets a large aperture, focusing on the subject and artistically blurring the background to make your subject “pop.”
Smart Shutter   The camera automatically takes the photo when people smile, wink or get into frame.
High-speed Burst    Captures rapid action frame by frame, by shooting continuously at a high speed while the shutter button is held down.
Handheld Night Scene    Take clear and steady pictures at night without the use of a tripod.
Low Light   For high-quality image capture in an amazing range of dimly lit situations.
Fisheye Effect  Add a classic photo distortion without a fisheye lens.
Miniature Effect for Movies &amp; Stills    Emphasizes perspectives for a miniature effect by blurring upper and lower portions of the image.
Toy Camera Effect   Simulates photos taken with “toy” or pinhole cameras, darkening the image at the edges to create a vignette effect.
Monochrome  Choose from three single-tone effects: Black-and-White, Sepia or Blue.
Super Vivid Super Vivid intensifies existing hues, saturating the scene with bright colors.
Poster Effect   Poster Effect combines several similar shades into one color, turning subtle gradations into eye-catching, scene-popping contrasts.
Fireworks   Grab brilliant images of skyrocketing fireworks.
Long Shutter    Use to blur moving subjects for artistic effect, ideal for urban night photography.
Movie   Record video in monaural sound. Unwanted scenes can be deleted in playback mode.
Creative Shot mode uses composition, color and lighting from your original image to create unique images with an artistic flair.
Not only is the PowerShot SX620 HS camera a stylish powerhouse, the camera also enables you to easily create artistic images with Creative Shot mode. In Creative Shot mode, the camera captures the original composition, automatically produces and saves five additional copies of the image and uses advanced Canon technologies to apply any of 46 filter options based on the individual scene, subject and exposure. Filter choices are grouped into Retro, Monochrome, Special and Natural categories to make exploring the world of artistic photography fun and easy, or you can simply select Auto to access the full range of effects. With Creative Shot mode, the result can lead to stunning artistic photos that are ideal for sharing.</p>

<p>Enable the Auto Zoom feature and the camera will automatically zoom in to help frame your subject and help keep it in focus.
Now, beautifully framed shots using the powerful 25x Optical Zoom are as easy as pressing the Auto Zoom button. With Auto Zoom, the camera automatically determines the correct size and framing by detecting the number of subjects. The system also detects faces that are too small, then zooms in to the proper length. Auto Zoom is a great feature for spontaneous everyday shooting, and especially useful for times when someone else (even a child) is using your camera, for instance at a tourist spot.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="bring-back-the-function-wheel-canon">Bring back the function wheel, Canon!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this camera to replace my SX-280 which was stolen. Amazon suggested this as the &ldquo;newer model&rdquo; of the same camera. My two main requirements are shooting pictures for my food blog (Canon&rsquo;s color temperature is just right for this, across their product line) and taking movies and telephoto stills of kid sporting events. For the latter, it&rsquo;s a plus that the zoom is 25x vs 20x for the 280. (By the way, whenever I get a new camera I immediately turn off the digital zoom. You don&rsquo;t need that extra noise in your picture. Just use the optical zoom and, if you need to get in closer, you can edit your photo after the fact.)The reason this review is three stars is that Canon made the terrible decision to remove the settings wheel on the back of the camera (used to toggle back and forth between auto mode, shutter priority, aperture priority etc) and move those settings several levels deep on the onscreen functions menu. There&rsquo;s a lot of good stuff there&ndash;there is now a fisheye mode, for example&ndash;but you&rsquo;ll have to shoot with the manual at your side to make use of them. The 280 was a point-and-shoot that had additional functionality readily available if you needed it. This is still a good point and shoot, but I am afraid most folks (including me) are not going to make the considerable effort to train themselves in the more complex features.Also, I was hoping I would be able to use the wireless, which never worked for me on the 280. Unfortunately I am on the Apple platform. There is no software available for my OS (10.11) and the touch-and-transfer technology is for Android only. It would be great to wirelessly send photos to my PC, but I can&rsquo;t do that.UPDATE: after spending some time with the manual, I discovered that Canon has actually removed the Aperture priority and Shutter priority features entirely. Instead, you have to choose one of many special programs such as &ldquo;Nighttime Handheld&rdquo; which give limited ability to control settings. If you liked the idea of using a very low aperture so only part of your picture is in focus (for example) that&rsquo;s no longer a choice for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had this camera for a few weeks and have loved it so far! The zoom is great! My pictures have come out crystal clear, even when my kids are moving as I take them! It is certainly not a professional camera, I have one of those too, but is great for travel! I bought this camera primarily to take on vacations when my other camera is too big and bulky. The size of this one is perfect and the features are great for what I need! I have figured out how to post pictures to Facebook from the camera which is a cool little feature! My friends have all asked which camera I have after seeing those pics as they have come out so clear! So far I love this camera!</p>

<h5 id="great-camera">Great Camera!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the SX620 as a pocket camera for special events, traveling, and so forth. The camera is quite easy to use and provides decent photos with very little effort. For the novice photographer, it is a great camera. If you simply need a simple camera for weddings, museums, galleries, parties, insurance claims, and those sorts of things, this is a nice camera to have on hand. The camera is a decent size, not too small, but also not too large. You can easily carry this camera in a jacket pocket, but it might be bulky for trousers. I did purchase an extra battery and extra memory card, which both came in useful during a casual day of shooting photos. The camera is still new, but I have had Canon cameras for years and count on their reliability and craftsmanship. You do have to get used to the flash not being automatic, as the user has to raise the flash manually. The quality of the photographs is great! For the cost, to include accessories, it is quite a good camera!</p>
