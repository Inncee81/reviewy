<h5 id="samsung-sd-cards-are-great-but-make-sure-you-get-a-real-one">Samsung SD cards are great, but make sure you get a real one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The genuine Samsung Evo Plus (And regular Evo) line of Micro SD cards are great. They are reliable and they live up to the speed and capacity classifications they claim to. I&rsquo;ve been using Samsung cards for years and they are the only brand that consistently doesn&rsquo;t give me any issues year after year.But be sure to authenticate the card upon arrival to make sure it&rsquo;s a genuine Samsung card with the stated capacity. Micro SD cards are a favorite thing for fraudsters to counterfeit because it&rsquo;s cheap and easy to do it. Right now the regular Evo line of Samsung cards (the white and orange colored ones) are the popular cards to counterfeit. Though with these higher grade cards (Evo Plus line with the white and red color scheme) starting to be more popular&hellip;&hellip;well it behooves anyone buying a new SD card to check it&rsquo;s authenticity upon arrival.What happens is that fraudulent card makers will take a 4GB Class 1 card that costs $1 to make, and hack the control chip that tells the computer what the capacity of the card is so your computer thinks it&rsquo;s a much larger card. Your computer will even try to write well over 4GB of data, but the data doesn&rsquo;t actually go anywhere. It&rsquo;s the same idea as putting a 100 gallon label on a 10 gallon bucket. You can pour 100 gallons into it, but 90 of those gallons are just going to flow out over the top and be lost forever.Below are some steps to help you ensure that you get a legitimate Samsung card.❖ For the last several years Samsung has made it&rsquo;s micro SD cards with white plastic. That means the actual card itself behind the colorful label on front is white. You can see the white plastic on the sides. Fake cards are almost always all black, because they are generically produced low cost cards that are given a fancy Samsung looking label on the front. If the card you get it black, it&rsquo;s not a Samsung. White plastic is more expensive to make, and fraudsters are all about doing it cheap. (See my images below of a real Samsung card with the white sides and back showing)❖ Buy only from reputable vendors. Amazon is a reliable vendor. And if there is a problem, they will take it back without hassle. There are dozens of other 3rd party vendors who are just as trustworthy. But make sure you are buying from one of those. Read their seller feedback. If there are numerous complaints from people who bought fake capacity cards or even cards that didn&rsquo;t work properly, find a different seller.❖ Make sure the listing looks right. This one is fine. It&rsquo;s a legitimate Samsung card. But scammers will post nearly identical looking listings on Amazon that have cards that look nearly identical buy don&rsquo;t have the Samsung logo at the top. (Recently another scammer replaced Samsung with Sanshen on fake cards. Other than that they were identical. They used the same font any everything, including the A in Samsung that doesn&rsquo;t have the bar in the middle)❖ Be careful of the price. If the price of the card you are looking at is significantly below the price of other listings for similar capacity cards, something is wrong. One of the biggest tricks scammers play is to make the price WAY lower than it should be in hopes of getting you to spend more time looking at the price tag than looking at the other things that don&rsquo;t add up right on the listing. Unusually low priced flash storage almost never works out well.❖ Test the card once you buy it! Regardless of who you buy your Micro SD card from or what brand it is, test it out. A thorough way to test it is with a utility app called &ldquo;h2testw&rdquo;. You can download it free. Just do a search for it on any search engine and you&rsquo;ll find it. That app writes single bit data to the drive until it&rsquo;s full, then it reads that data back to make sure it&rsquo;s readable. It will tell you what the actual capacity of this disk is. The default language on that utility is German, but you can switch to English easily. It is not fast. It will take several hours to test a 256GB card. Just run it overnight and check the results in the morning. This is smart to do even if you have no doubts that you have an authentic Samsung (or other brand name) product. Sometimes things go wrong in manufacturing and quality control and a dud gets through. An app like h2testw will verify that your legitimate brand name card is working properly. And if it&rsquo;s not, you&rsquo;ll know right away while you are still in your 30 day exchange window.</p>

<h5 id="counterfeit-from-3rd-party-amazon-seller-open-group-wireless">COUNTERFEIT, from 3rd party amazon seller &ldquo;Open Group Wireless&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit:I received a counterfeit card, as confirmed by Samsung tech support. I just began the dispute resolution process a few minutes ago, and will update this review when concluded.Edit #2:Seller &ldquo;Open Group Wireless&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t respond to my message that they sold me a counterfeit.I tried to file a claim.OMG, I filed one day too late.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to file an A-to-z Guarantee claim. Your opportunity to do so ended May 16, 2017.&ldquo;FYI: Samsung tech support informed me their cards are NOT made in Taiwan.I searched online, including image searches, and results show that authentic cards are made of white plastic, and if the body of the card is black plastic, then it&rsquo;s counterfeit.The back of my card has the following four lines of text:CEMMCGS08BCASH-T0LYXC20 1607MADE IN TAIWAN</p>

Some of the worst performing cards in this review also happen to be the most expensive.Not all 633x cards are created equal. The two cards reviewed from Lexar and Transcend are both marked as 633x but vary in performance greatly.4k video recording using action cams and drone cameras have a typical bitrate of 60mbps or 100mbps, corresponding to 7.5MB/s to 12.5MB/s. All cards in this review should theoretically be able to handle this usage easily.Using microsd card as supplemental phone storage potentially could benefit from a faster card,Best Looking Card (if it matters):Sandisk Extreme Pro: Red/Gold with white printLexar 1000x: White/Gold with Black/White printSamsung Pro+: White/Black with a red stripe and Black/White printPNY Turbo: Lime Green/Black with Black/White printUpdate 9/14/2015: Added additional cards to the list.Update 9/18/2015: Added 128GB Sandisk Ultra and Lexar 633xUpdate 9/21/2015: Added 2 PNY Elite Performance cardsUpdate 11/28/2015: Added Sandisk Extreme and Extreme plus 64GBUpdate 11/29/2015: Added Samsung EVO+ 128GB and PNY high performance 128GB</p>

<p>I immediately installed this SD card in my cell phone and its working wonders. Because of its huge memory, and highly transfer rate, I can record hours of video from my cell phone using processor heavy video apps, recording at the highest settings. Most future phones will have memory built in, and I hope they will be at this transfer rate. If not, I will hold onto older phones that accept SD cards like the Samsung Evo.</p>

The phone read everything without any problems.</p>
