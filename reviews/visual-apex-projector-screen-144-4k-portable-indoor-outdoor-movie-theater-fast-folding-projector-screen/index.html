<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="i-am-extremely-disappointed-this-product-arrived-damaged-updated-review">I am extremely disappointed! This product arrived damaged - UPDATED REVIEW</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATED REVIEW: My screen originally arrived defective. After return and a refund, I decided to reorder, since the screen had such solid reviews. My second screen arrived defect free. I was able to assemble the screen within a matter of minutes, and test it out. I have now used this screen on several occasions for our family movie night, and I can truly say that despite my initial review, I am completely satisfied. The screen is easy for one person to setup and tear down. It comes with a solid carry case, and the screen is durable. The aluminum frame is light weight, yet sturdy, and its storage is compact, given the overall size of the screen.ORIGINAL FEEDBACK: I am extremely disappointed! This product arrived damaged, although the box it shipped in was intact, and didn&rsquo;t appear to have any damage. I ordered this screen for a family get together, and will be unable to use this, since it is now utterly useless.This screen has two legs that mount to the main screen bracket/housing in order to keep it upright. One of the legs had broken revits, and the support bracket that mounts to the main screen was missing. I was looking forward to using this, and now I have to return it&hellip;.needless to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy&rdquo; is an understatement.</p>

<h5 id="want-a-super-large-and-portable-projection-screen-for-less-than-the-cost-of-renting-one">Want a Super Large and Portable Projection Screen For Less Than The Cost of Renting One???</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Needed a 12&rsquo; diagonal, portable screen ASAP to project my wedding reception project onto and didn&rsquo;t want to pay about the same to rent as it costs to purchase. The unit is easy to set up and take down/store within 5 minutes or less. While the materials are not going to be of commercial standard for multiple uses over long periods of time, if handled with care, it should produce years of use. The screen stretches slightly and all of the wrinkles fall out, or are not visible to the eye once projecting. I&rsquo;ve since used this screen to project shows at over a dozen events without any issues. I do use a pair of sandbags designed for photography stand use to stabilize the screen against any accidental bumping in busy locations or outside to stabilize against any breeze.</p>

<h5 id="132-megascreen-is-the-bomb">132&rdquo; Megascreen is the Bomb!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The 132&rdquo; screen is gigantic and perfect for movie nights. We actually have this set up inside, and it just fits the 8 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> foot ceilings. I would have gone with the 144&rdquo; if it would have fit, but this is close. The screen was easy to set up, and super sturdy when all put together. I did not have any of the fit problems with the legs that I saw mentioned in another review. Also, if you can leave the screen set up for a few weeks, the middle crease goes away all on its own.Performance-wise, everyone is just gobsmacked by the size of this screen. Standard DVD movies are okay on this, but Blu-Ray and HD are perfect. The photo that has accompanied the Visual Apex Projectoscreens looks to be a smaller model. This is the best $240 I&rsquo;ve spent on our home video system.</p>

<h5 id="great-movie-screen">Great movie screen!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great movie screen!We had a backyard movie night for our girls and it was perfect!I am so glad I picked this screen and not those inflatable ones. Less electrical cords, noise and/or risk of deflating.This screen is perfect. It is big enough for indoor or outdoor set ups.. I didn&rsquo;t need to secure it, it wasn&rsquo;t windy and stood up pretty firm during the whole movie time. We set it up in front of a chain-link fence. The images were still sharp and color perfect. Well, that depends of your projector too!!</p>

<h5 id="beautiful-screen-easy-to-use">Beautiful Screen - Easy to Use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We love to have outdoor movie nights in the summer. For 10 years we only used a regular old fashioned movie projector screen. I finally took the plunge and purchased this beautiful 10&rsquo; screen and wow! Quite impressive.So far I am very impressed. After setting it up the first time, which of course took a little while because I had to read and learn how to do it, it made sense and was easy&hellip;.. I&rsquo;m sure the next time it will be easier.While I&rsquo;m giving a glowing 5 star review now, in all honesty, I&rsquo;ve only used it once so far. The quality of the material is excellent. The frame is light weight and easy to assemble. The takedown was even easier. It would be nice if I could leave it up all season and just store it, but I just don&rsquo;t have the room to leave it assembled.That said, I think Amazon should send reminder emails out 3 or 6 months after a purchase is made for a second review. This way we can really test out the product and make sure it&rsquo;s still working properly and it hasn&rsquo;t broken or something! The snaps for the screen all feel secure and tight now&hellip; the screen is taut and looks beautiful. Let&rsquo;s hope it stays that way come September.So right now I&rsquo;m giving 5 stars! Ask me again at the end of summer!</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-drive-in-movies-football-season-or-parties-quality-made">Perfect for drive-in movies, football season, or parties QUALITY MADE!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The frame is professional quality. The screen is huge. Leave it in the sun and any creases smooth right out. We used a ViewSonic 3200 lumen HD projector, an HDMI cable and an Samsung HD DVD player, and it was as close to giant HD as you can get. The screen sets up easily, and yes its tight but fits great. The frame and legs are so well made I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Comes with rope and stakes, so you can really tie it down for outdoor use. Everything comes in a nice zippered bag, and actually folded back up into the bag at the end. If you have the room, get this one, it&rsquo;s really big and so well made.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy setup And tear down</p>

<h5 id="love-love">Love, love</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love, love, love!! Set up is very easy, although it may take two people due to the size. Some reviews say the material can tear at the buttons.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Practical to dismount and nice carry bag.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="can-t-go-wrong-buying-this-screen">Can&rsquo;t go wrong buying this screen!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen and frame are awesome. The video says 10 minute setup, more like 2 once it&rsquo;s out of the bag. Love the black backing, keeps light from being lost through the screen!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent option</p>

<p>This screen worked great. The frame was amazingly easy to assemble. It&rsquo;s kinda ingenious how easy the screen unfolds. Feels really solid too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-poolside-viewing-or-camping">Great for poolside viewing or camping.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it! Bought it for an outdoor poolside theater and couldn&rsquo;t be happier. Lightweight, compact, goes up in a snap (literally, it snaps into place) and comes down just as easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great picture quality. Great for mobile use. Takes about 15-20 to set up or tear down.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-screen-is-very-good-and-projects-well">This screen is very good and projects well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen is very good and projects well. We already used it thrice in our church events. A good buy instead of renting it from the facility it was already paid for.</p>
