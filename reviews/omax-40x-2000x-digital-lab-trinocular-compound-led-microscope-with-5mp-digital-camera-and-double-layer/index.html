<h4 id="product-specifications">Product Specifications</h4>

<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4>

<p>This is a digital biological trinocular compound microscope that includes a digital imaging system. The digital microscopy comes with a 45° inclined 360° swiveling trinocular sliding viewing head, two pairs of widefield eyepieces, four achromatic objectives, stain-resistant double layer mechanical stage with scales, coarse &amp; fine focusing, NA 1.25 Abbe condenser and variable intensity LED transmitted illumination system. It offers eight levels of magnification power: 40X-80X-100X-200X-400X-800X-1000X-2000X. The 5MP (2592x1944 pixels) USB digital imaging system that captures still microscope images and live video on computer. The included software compatible with windows, Mac OS and Linux operating system can also be used to make measurements. It is easy to mount a darkfield condenser to switch a brightfield microscope to a darkfield microscope. This type of digital compound microscopy is perfect for teaching demonstration and clinical examination, laboratories and advanced applications.</p>

<h5 id="very-good-microscope">Very good microscope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This microscope is awesome for college or the home enthusiast, So glad i bought the trinocular type. With this microscope you can easily upgrade the camera without tearing it all down like the built in versions and you can also view and take pics/vids while looking through the eye piece at the same time HUGE BONUS. If you are wanting to learn how to use it they have an easy instructional video on youtube.Received all the equipment and so far its been very interesting. Ill post a vid with some pics. FYI: The vid i have uploaded on this review is a downgrade from what it actually looks like.Pros: Very sturdy, easy to use, you can view through the eye piece while recording at the same time &ldquo;trinocular&rdquo;, led light can be dimmed, camera software is easy to use.Cons: Fine tune adjustment is kinda sensitive and has a little play at max settings, the 20 times eye pieces are real short and when you look through them your nose hits the base of the microscope, doesn&rsquo;t come with slides, doesn&rsquo;t come with a manual however the camera part comes with some great software and manual</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-microscope">Great Microscope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Notes:This was a great, easy to use microscope. It was shipped the same day and arrived on time before the end of the day.The lower resolution setting on the camera allows you to capture higher frames-per-second video while the high resolution setting allows for much less frames-per-second recording of video. What this means is that if you want a more fluid, natural looking video recording, you will have to use a lower resolution setting.Pros:The camera was really easy to set up. You take it out of the wrapping, screw on the 5mm lens and place it in the top viewing area. Really easy. It doesn&rsquo;t click into place or anything, but it does have an O-ring preventing it from moving too easily.The software worked out of the box on a Windows 7 computer. I have not yet tried to install the software on a Mac or and Linux flavors, but this is something I will do in the future.Further, the construction is solid. It did not feel cheap or like it was overly fragile.Cons:The microscope doesn&rsquo;t come with any documentation other than a slip of paper, but they make up for by sending you an email with documentation links and how to download the manual pdf.The viewing areas(being the eyepieces and the camera insert) focus at different lengths unfortunately. What this means is that something may be focused in the camera on screen, but if you look through the eyepieces you will have to adjust the focus. Not too much of a difference, so it&rsquo;s not too difficult to focus to either viewing areas.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="garbage">Garbage</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the OMAX M83ES-C50U for $339.00. The first scope had a deep scratch in the glass lens which is glued into the microscope body below the viewing head (see pictures). There was also a lot of metal debris within this area and I have to assume that a piece of this metal scratched the lens during factory assembly. I returned this scope and ordered a replacement which is identical the original part number. When assembling the second (replacement) scope, the right eyepiece will not slide into the diopter adjusting ring because the ring is bent from assembly. At this point, I&rsquo;ve determined that the OMAX brand is overpriced Chinese made garbage. I do understand that this is not a Nikon or whatever, but at the $300+ price point it definitely needs to be usable. I will not be purchasing anything further from OMAX and I&rsquo;m hesitant to purchase an Amscope because I&rsquo;ve read that they are both produced by the same &ldquo;Chinese Factory&rdquo;. I saw many positive reviews for OMAX, although there were some negatives. I rolled the dice&hellip;and lost. Both OMAX scopes were sold by Amazon and both scopes have been returned easily. The Amscope equivalent is being sold directly from Amscope which means it might be more difficult to return if need be. This is another consideration when purchasing a microscope.</p>

<h5 id="great-value-for-professional-labs-and-hobby-biologists-alike">Great value for professional labs and hobby biologists alike!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great microscope with many features that usually cost thousands of $$$! We have been using this instrument for routine microbiology in our biology lab in a professional environment and it has served us very well. Software is easy to use and the camera takes great pictures, which allows fast and easy documentation and sharing of our results. A great value and highly recommended. Note: the focusing knobs are very touchy and take a little practice to get used to. Still, this is a fantastic value!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-would-give-it-six-stars-if-i-could">I would give it six stars if I could</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, this microscope is absolutely unbeatable. The camera makes it possible to show my daughter many natural wonders, from plankton to pond critters to growing crystals, all from my laptop screen. The optics are good enough that this will last her until college. The only fault is that the auto-brightness function on the camera software is a little too eager. You often get a washed-out image, then a small movement makes it too dark. I suggest using the manual gain setting, especially if you are going to take video.</p>
