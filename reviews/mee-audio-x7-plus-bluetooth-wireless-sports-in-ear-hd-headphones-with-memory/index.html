<h5 id="the-best-active-headphones-i-have-tested-fit-well-sound-great-and-cheaper-than-the-x2">The best active headphones I have tested, fit well, sound great and cheaper than the X2</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tested 5 sets of Bluetooth headphones between $25 and $125 to find that perfect pair of headphones for running and workouts. I tested the following,Jaybird X2 ($125, average overall)MEE X7 Plus ($100, best higher end set)Bluephonic Wireless Sport Bluetooth Headphones ($60, poor overall)Phaiser BHS-730 ($36, best budget set)Anker SoundBuds Sport ($25, poor overall)tl;dr review of the MEE X7 Plus: The X7 is my recommendation for a highend part of active Bluetooth headphones. The sound quality is as good as the Jaybird X2 but is much more enjoyable. Good range, controls and excellent fit round out all the essential attributes of an active Bluetooth headset and I strongly recommend this for any one looking in this price range.Detailed ReviewBuild, appearance, accessoriesThe MEE X7 looks the part of an active headphone and the build feels as solid as any. The accessories are basic, but have everything you need. It includes 3 sizes of silicone earpieces, a short (~6in) charging cable, a detailed manual and a carrying case. I do think the case is a little small and it feels like you are crushing the headphones a little to get them in the case (though I don&rsquo;t think any harm will come to them this way)ControlsThe X7 uses a standard 3 button inline remove for controls. One button is pause/power, the other two handle volume and track navigation. The buttons are large enough to easily find and use while running and I&rsquo;ve had no serious concerns or issues with the controls.Fit/StayPotentially the most important of all the factors. I tested the headphone fit and stay both while running (couch to 5K program on a treadmill) and with a series of body weight exercises (think pushups, sit ups, ab exercises etc, this require both standing, sitting and laying positions).General Fit/Stay: The X7 uses a different design than any other sets I&rsquo;ve reviews, but the memory wire solution works very well, it keeps the earbuds firmly in my ears. The first time you try to put them on may be confusing as both myself and a friend who tried them struggled with the first application. The clip on the cord helps manage the cable and it works ok, could be better, but with how short the cable is, its not a serious concern.Running Stay: These stay very well while running. I&rsquo;ve have yet to have them fall out or move very much. They do pick up some noise from my steps, but I do not believe it is any worse than others.Workout Stay: The X7 also does very well here. The short cable stays out of the way while stretching or moving between the floor and standing positions. I still wish it was a little better, but I would consider it the best of the 5 I tested.RangeRange was tested by putting my iPhone 6 in my office and walking away from it until I reached a point where the sound dropped or cut out. Testing was done with a full charge on the earbuds. Measurements are approximate and I notate when the signal had to go through walls (drywall). I repeated this test using my hand to cover the receiver on the earbuds, again with three cardboard boxes over my iPhone (to simulate the phone in a pocket, backpack etc) and then finally with both my phone and the ear bud receiver covered.Unobstructed range: Around 35 feet and through 3 walls, tied for the longest range.Transmitter blocked range: About the same, tied for best of the 5 tested.Receiver blocked range: Around 27 feet and through 2 walls, tied for 2nd best.Both blocked range: About the same, tied for best in the group.Overall: The range numbers from the X7 are very good, easily tied for best of the group. I wouldn&rsquo;t be worried about range issues until reaching at least 30 feet or more.SoundI consider myself an audiophile, so sound quality is something that I both care about and appreciate. My normal &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; listening setup is lossless CD quality music files (FLAC), a Fiio X7 music player and a pair of Ultrasone Pro 900 headphones. Its fair to say the none of these headphones live up to that quality, but I try to provide a honest and &ldquo;usage appropriate&rdquo; review of the sound of these earbuds. All sound testing was done with these earbuds, with iTunes store quality music (AAC, 256kbps) streamed from my iPhone 6.Quality: The sound quality is very good, equal to the Jaybird X2 and noticeably better than the cheaper sets I tested. The sound is clear and pleasant to listen to. Large, loud and/or complex pieces of music do not produce the muddy sound present in the cheaper sets.Enjoyment: This is where the X7 really shines against the Jaybird X2. The X2 has very boring sound (weak bass, strong treble) but the X7 has a strong, driving bass and is exactly what I want while working out. Combine this with the high quality and these actually sound very good, easily the best of the group.ConclusionThe MEE X7 isn&rsquo;t without some weak points (fit isn&rsquo;t perfect, case is too small) but it is clearly the best set I have tested. Excellent and enjoyable sound along with the strong fit makes this stand out in all the places it needs to. I would strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a set at this price range and would strongly recommend it over the more expensive Jaybird X2.</p>

<h5 id="sound-nothing-particularly-bad-to-say">Sound - Nothing particularly bad to say</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are some decent sounding headphones with major fit and usability issues.Sound - Nothing particularly bad to say. They are bass heavy and lack treble definition but it&rsquo;s not objectionable. I think it&rsquo;s a good sound for working out.Fit - This was unfortunately a deal breaker for me. The earbud &ldquo;capsules&rdquo; are unusually large (probably to hold batteries) and as a result the way they sat in my ears was quite uncomfortable. I wore them for 8 hours at work and started to develop pressure points. Also, the large design prevents you from putting the ear tips deep into your ear canals. They sit &ldquo;on-top&rdquo; and so much as a smile or slight movement would break the seal. As a result I experienced poor sound isolation. I experimented with the different tip sizes offered and none seemed to alleviate the issue. For the record I am familiar with this type of over-the-ear IEM fit so the problems I experienced are a result of the design and shape of my ears, NOT my technique.Usability - My main gripe is how MEE Audio chose to map out the remote functions. Pressing the center button twice (which normally skips to the next track) results in a phone call for whatever reason. To skip tracks on this headset you must press and hold the volume up or down button for 2-3 seconds. I found this particularly annoying. First, I am very used to the standard remote presses, and when I forgot I ended up on an awkward phone call with somebody. Second, to skip tracks means you must keep one hand occupied for a number of seconds, rather than a very quick double press. There is also a slight delay when pressing buttons, and the lowest volume on the headset is a few clicks above mute on my iPhone. I found that rather odd.I had zero connection issues, and pairing with my phone was very easy.Battery Life - I used the headset at 50% volume for 8 hours and I had battery to spare.</p>

<h5 id="good-sound-but-low-maximum-volume-buy-some-comply-foam-tips-to-improve-this">Good sound but low maximum volume (buy some Comply foam tips to improve this)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use these primarily for the gym&hellip; To me they are just ok with my biggest complaint being the low maximum volume. I generally stream music (google music) and have found sometimes the volume won&rsquo;t go that high. I would say make sure your music source has a strong volume level if you pick these up. I find myself having to switch songs often trying to find a high enough volume.Like others mentioned, they will crackle and pop sometimes if your phone if in your pocket and moving around. I believe this is an issue on most BT earbud headsets because of their tiny antennas.Sound quality is rather good and comparable to a mid-range set of wired earbuds . Build quality is ok. Battery life is ok. They fit great for working out.Would I buy these again? Not for the nearly $100 they are listed for. I picked them up for $40 on a gold box deal and I think that&rsquo;s about the right price.MEE makes some pretty good and cost effective headphones and I&rsquo;m hoping they can make some improvements in the volume department.EDIT 3/10/17:After reading through the Q&amp;A&hellip;. I ended up ordering some Comply comfort foam tips for these and they sound somewhat louder (and better) because of the the noise isolation these tips provide. (thanks Arkasai). I highly recommend picking up these tips if you are underwhelmed by the maximum volume. Would love to see MEE include foam tips with these.</p>
