<h5 id="sound-that-is-clear-and-loud-is-this-speaker-s-all-about">sound that is clear and loud is this speaker&rsquo;s all about</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi got this speaker yesterday and since then I have been using it listening music and used this now when I am doing Zumba dances at home.This is my third speaker so I have something to compare to and so far this one beats my two speakers in terms of how loud as it can be. I love to volume it up during Zumba time that makes me more energetic sound odd but that&rsquo;s what I felt everytime. It&rsquo;s length about 20cm with thickness is 7cm it&rsquo;s a bit longer than what I have but its totally fine with me.Since I got it I charge it and up to now it still has juice in it not lowbat yet I been using it for 8 hours playing music in it ,it says battery life can lasts 30 hours well see then.The most specs I like about this speaker is its splash proof and dustproof and that is so perfect for us becausewe love to hang out in lakes.pools now that I have this kind of speaker I can enjoy music without getting worried of ruining it because it will get wet.Other good thing the sound is clear and bass has good quality.The speaker is built where you can hang/hook it up to chieve more protection and it comes with strap in it.I t comes with its cable and and a cord where I easlily connet it to my phone then play music .I can find any issues with it as it seems made to lasts and it feels durable I hope this will lasts as I like it very much.All the color choices are beautiful especially then blue one but we never get wrong in choosing black so I am happy with what I choose.I actually suddenly drop it earlier but since its proofed it just bounce and still playing my music. This speaker is easy to operate for first timers so no problem beside all the buttons located in one spot ,easy access so no worries on that part.I am HAPPY with it so I will recommend this to friends as this provides same quality to more expensive ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sound">Great sound!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great! Could use a bit more range. Volume is very good.Sound quality is very good.Haven&rsquo;t tried the mic yet.Since it is for outside use and you have to leave it out there to charge they should use screws that don&rsquo;t rust in a week.Update:Great customer service! They contacted me about the screws and offered to replace the unit. Also, the range issue is only with my iPad, not an iPhone, etc. so probably more a problem with the iPad&rsquo;s range, not this unit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-speaker-that-you-might-want-to-consider-strongly-recommended">Awesome speaker that you might want to consider! Strongly recommended!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I already have tried 4 different Bluetooth speakers and this is going to be my one of the best among all! Very light and gives me a great grip while holding the speaker. Love the design and most likely, the solar part is the best! All the function buttons are on the one side of the speaker and there are outlet and charging port on the other side well covered with the soft cap. You might want to know about the sound quality and you bet! This provides such a great sound for your music that won&rsquo;t make you regret!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-compact-product-with-amazing-sound-quality">Great compact product with amazing sound quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great compact product with amazing sound quality. play time is really really long for such a small device. 30 hrs is quite a long time and good thing is you don&rsquo;t have to plug in to charge it just keep it somewhere in sunlight and job will be done. Overall I liked this product and its worth the money. upper layer makes it look good and anti-slippery. Again to summarize.1. Long play time.2. Just keep it in sunlight and get it charged not to worry about charging.3. Good sound quality and its loud too.4. small and compact</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solar-power-dependable">Solar power dependable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This speaker is really a whole new concept. There are very little speakers that are solar powered. It is great to have in all your outdoor activity. Knowing that enjoying your favorite music doesn&rsquo;t depend im having an electric outlet to recharge. With as little as 30 minutes of solar charging you will get about 15 minutes of usage time. Sound is great and it is strongly built. You also have the option of regular electric charging. Be ready to enjoy with or without electric power.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-solar-speaker">Excellent solar speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I needed a new speaker for the beach or for days away or holidays .this is great as its solar powered so i can put it in the sun to charge which was quick to charge or charge through a usb ,this is a good looking solar speaker which has a blue silicon cover around it ,this is a very robust speaker which has good sound quality which is crystal clear and has amazing volume for the size of it , i like that its splash proof and shock proof especially in my house !!! so this will be good for my parties to listen to my music and ok with spillages ,this has a useful flashlight on and was easy to connect to my phone through bluetooth and has a built in microphone ,this comes with a strap and a clip so easy to carry around ,this is a good portable speaker and i am pleased with it.OVERALL THE battery life up to 30-Hour Playtime great thanks to the solar panel that can charge lithium battery in as early as 10 mins&hellip;.Very pleased with this speaker,definitely worth your money</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-absolutely-love-this-speaker">We absolutely love this speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We absolutely love this speaker. The bass response is surprisingly good for a unit this size and the solar charger really works well. It&rsquo;s ruberized all the way around and comes with a carabiner for hanging it, which is really useful in the garden, as our old bluetooth speaker would often fall over from it&rsquo;s own vibrations. I&rsquo;d def buy another for a friend if I need a nice gift for an outdoor type. This would be great for camping too, as it has a solar charger.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good-i-used-it-at-work-most-of-the">So far so good. I used it at work most of the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good. I used it at work most of the day today and last night watching movies and the speaker preformed nicely. I bought it for my boat and camping and I&rsquo;m doing both this weekend so I&rsquo;ll be putting it to the test. Ok so I just got back from an awesome sailing/camping trip and we enjoyed really nice sound from this speaker all weekend uninterrupted. It&rsquo;s a great product. I&rsquo;m impressed and so was everyone else on the trip. Buy with confidence. This thing rocks!</p>

<h5 id="style-and-design-are-good-but-the-longest-playtime-i-could-get-is">style and design are good, but the longest playtime I could get is &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>style and design are good, but the longest playtime I could get is 2 hours. most times it starts beeping low power after 45 minutes and goes dead in the next half hour.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="real-quality-sound-listen-to-the-video">Real quality sound. Listen to the video.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Awesome! This is a solid quality speaker. It&rsquo;s cool that&rsquo;s also solar powered. I recorded the sound on my iPhone so I&rsquo;m not sure how good it is. But it really puts out the sound.</p>

<p>Great idea, poor execution. It worked as described for a couple weeks, then the volume dropped to barely audible. Hasn&rsquo;t been usable since.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-speaker">Love this speaker</h5>
