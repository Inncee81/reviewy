Machine learning based sentiment analysis for online shoping reviews

Our concept is simple, using machine learning techniques and a series of textual and lexical algorithms we are researching and building the next step in **textual sentiment analysis** with the idea to provide consumers with an easy way to identify how people feel about the products they buy.

Many times people would like to have a way to know if a product would really makes them happy as advertised, sometimes our friends own different products and we would like to get in touch with people who are already using the product we are thinking about buying.

As an experiment we are collecting a catalogue of products and using our tools to analyze the true feeling behind products reviews, for this purpose we are developing and creating a deep neural processor which is **capable of identifying human emotions through text**.

### Our Model

Combining the wordnet dictionary, the first part of our system feeds the lexical trainer. There's a subdivision of words and expressions based on word and terminology entanglement to create a set of opposing groups which finally allow the sentiment engine to collect with great accuaracy a dataset of sentences and expressions for further analysis.

Using techinques based on probability and likeability the system will match signals that help it to learn the effects of different word categories (verbs,adverbs,negation) on the particular expression, example: *I'm happy* vs *I'm extremely happy* vs  *This product was making me happy, now I feel deeply annoyed*.

Surprisingly the system opearates at incredible speeds, and if desired is able to suggest sentences for human proof analysis enhancing or modifying accuracy through a series of % type modifiers, the database is growing exponentially specially when combined with a steady documents (text reviews) payload.

### Operational details

We have managed to achieve top speeds analysing 43,678 characters per second or 43 characters per millisecond. Our GPUs are building a large database containing so far 87 Terabytes. The linear progression system is now capable of performing sentiment analysis for an average review in aproximately 0.00932 milliseconds. 

Below is a graphic showing the average processing time for the average text length.

We collect anonimous information like reviews or comments around an specific product through websites and social media outlets which allow the system to learn, grow and determine the feeling or sentiment a product has on people wether positive or negative.

After the system integrates the different entry points it will express the sentiment as "Loved by people" or "Not Loved by people" this is an easy way to interpret the numerical value calculated by the system in terms of sentiment.

This will quickly guide the consumer about the probability of certain product to be good for them or not, in this way people can further check certain products and price ranges.

### Future Applications

* Pre Buy consumer research.
* Finding the best products before you buy.
* Satisfaction comparison across different brands, models and products.
* Demand generation predictions.
* Applications on different areas like reviews of expriences, movie critics, news or particular situations.
* Group sentiment analysis.

#### Next Steps

Our system needs to grow, the only way to grow even faster and accurate is with more and more data. The more data entries for a particular product in terms of reviews, mentions, retweets, comments on youtube, comments on discussion boards, facbook and review sites the more accurate and trustworthy the sentiment will be.

If you own or have substantially used a product and would like to help with a review, please leave a comment on our facebook page for that particular product, ask your friends to tweet our channel with some reviews. Anything that helps us getting a new text comment will help to build a more accurate sentiment value.
